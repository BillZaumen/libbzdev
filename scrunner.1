.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
SCRUNNER (Scripting Context Runner) uses a scripting language to run an
application, typically a simulation or animation. For the first form
of the command, each input file
.I IFILE
is the name of a file containing a script, with a file name of "\fB\-\fR"
denoting standard input. If preceded by a
.B \-t
command-line argument, the script has elevated privileges when the
.B \-\-trustLevel
option is not 0.
.B Scrunner
will try to guess the scripting language from the file extension, but
the language can be set by using the
.B \-L
option. If the input file does not have an extension and the
.B \-L
option is not used, the scripting language is assumed to be ESP,
which is described in the API documentation for the BZDev class library.
The script that is processed is in effect the script produced
by concatenating the input files in the order in which they appear.
The second form places one input file before the options, and the third
form places a
.BR \-s
option before that first input file and also creates some arguments as
values that can be used by a script. The second and third options are
useful when a script is an executable file and are normally not used
directly (see the description of the
.B \-s
option and the EXECUTABLE SCRIPTS section for details).
.PP
Initially, the scripting environment contains a single variable named
.B scripting
which should be used as the parent of any subclass of
org.bzdev.scripting.ScriptingContext that is created. These subclasses
included org.bzdev.devqsim.Simulation, org.bzdev.anim2d.Animation2D, and
org.bzdev.drama.DramaSimulation.  These subclasses implement the interface
org.bzdev.ObjectNamerOps, which includes a createFactory method. The factories
created with this method can then be used to create simulation objects. While
.B scrunner
loads the factories from the BZDev class library, one may need other factories
as well. Factories are expected to be packaged as modular JAR files that
provide implementations of the class org.bzdev.obnaming.NamedObjectFactory.
.PP
Due to a bug in some versions of Javascript, "new" cannot always be used to
create a simulation. For these cases (Simulation, Animation2D, and
DramaSimulation are included), the object
.B scripting
has a series of methods named
.B create
the first argument of which is the class or the name of the class whose
instance is to be created. This method is overloaded and can take up to
11 additional arguments.
.PP
It is often useful to import classes from java packages so that they
can be named using a simple identifier. The
.B
scripting
object has a number of methods named
.B importClass
that will assign a class to a variable with the same name. For inner
classes, a period (".") is replaced with a dollar sign ("$") in the
class name.  These names exclude the package names. The first argument
to
.B importClass
is a string containing the name of a java package (for example, "java.util").
The second argument is a class name.  A third argument, which is optional,
is a boolean argument that, when true, indicates that a class' inner
classes should also be imported, and a fourth optional argument indicates
that the inner class search is recursive. An additional method
named
.B importClasses
provides "syntactic sugar" to simplify the use of the
.B importClass
methods.  The first argument to
.B importClasses
is a package name and the second argument is an object in the
scripting language. For ECMAScript, this object will have property
names that correspond to ECMAScript variables and property values that
are strings giving the name of the factory class to be created. This
name should be a simple name - one without the package (the package is
provided by the first argument). The use of these methods eliminates a
dependency on which script engine is in use for a given scripting
language.
.PP
The variable
.B scripting
also provides the methods
.BR getReader ,
.BR getWriter,
and
.BR getErrorWriter ,
all called with no arguments. These methods return
.B scrunner \'s
input stream, output stream, and error stream respectively. The
objects returned are instances of java.io.Writer for output streams
and java.io.Reader for input streams. For portability, these methods
should be used instead of script-engine dependent functions. As an
example, the Rhino javascript engine that comes with Java-7 provides
the functions.
.B print
and
.BR println .
The function
.B print
does not terminate each call with a newline character. For the Nashorn
javascript engine that comes with Java-8, the
.B println
function is not implemented, and the
.B print
function terminates each string printed with a newline character.
Because of the variations between various implementations of ECMAScript,
the use of
.B print
and
.B println
is discouraged (both are vendor extensions not specified by the
ECMAScript specification).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-s\fR[\fISOPTION ]...
Specify arguments. This must be the first argument if it is provided. Each
.I SOPTION
contains a colon, the letter
.BR B ,
.BR D ,
.BR I ,
.BR L ,
.BR S ,
or
.BR E
followed by a comma and a variable name, except for
.B E
which is followed by a comma and the keyword
.BR true .
The letters indicate the type of an argument:
.BR B
for boolean,
.BR D
for double,
.BR I
for integer,
.BR L
for long, and
.BR S
for String.  The corresponding variable names must start with
a lower or upper case letter or an underscore, followed by any number
of digits, lower or upper case letters, or underscores.  The letter
.B E
indicates that an
.B \-\-exit
option should be automatically added. If there are N
.I SOPTION
arguments, excluding any  whose type is
.BR E ,
the first file name and any options following that file name must
be the corresponding values. An example is provided in the
EXECUTABLE SCRIPTS section below.
.TP
.B \-\-
End of options.  This option is needed when an input file's name
begins with
.B \-
unless the file name is
.BR \- ,
denoting standard input.
.TP
.B \-\-listCodeBase
List all the URLs provided in
.B \-\-codebase
options and then exit.
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-modules\  MODULES
Add a common-separated list
.I MODULES
of module names to any existing list, or create a new list if there
is no existing list. The
.B \-\-add\-modules
option is needed when there are no module dependencies that would make
the specified modules accessible. An example is a module that is used
in a script but that does not provide implementations of the class
org.bzdev.obnaming.NamedObjectFactory.
.TP
.BI \-\-classpathCodebase\  URLPATH
.TQ
.BI \-\-codebase\  URLPATH
Specifies directories and jar files for the class path (for the
.B \-\-classpathCodebase
option) and  the module path (for the
.B \-\-codebase
option).
.I URLPATH
may be a URL giving the location of the classes or a path name in the
local file system.  The character "|" is used as a path separator,
with the sequence "||" interpreted as a literal "|", so that for an
odd number of "|" characters in a row, only the final one is treated
as a path separator.  If file name must start with "|", use a "file"
URL and encode the "|" as %7C.  If the starting sequence of a path
component contains a ":" (the first one if there are more than one),
and that sequence of characters is syntactically valid at the start of
a URL, the path component is treated as a URL. Otherwise it is a file
name.  This rule implies that Windows file names such as C:mycode.jar
will be confused with a URL, so a URL should be used instead.  If a
file name is not absolute, it is interpreted relative to the current
working directory. The directory "..." refers the directory in which
the BZDev library's JAR files resides (on Debian Linux systems, this
directory is /usr/share/java, the standard location for Java
libraries.)  Multiple
.B \-\-codebase
and
.B \-\-classpathCodebase
options are allowed. For file names, a leading "~" followed by the
name separator ("/" for Unix) is expanded to the user\'s home
directory, a file name consisting of only "~" is replaced with the
user\'s home directory, a leading "~~" is replaced with "~", and a
leading "..." followed by the name separator ("/" for Unix) is
replaced by the directory in which the BZDev class library's JAR file
is located.  For the
.B \-\-classpathCodebase
case, a component can be any could appear in a Java
.B \-classpath
option, with the exception that a '|' has to be escaped.  If a codebase
has classes in the unnamed package, the
.B \-\-classpathCodebase
option must be used as all code bases on the module path must contain
classes in named packages.
.TP
.BI \-D NAME\fB=\fIVALUE
Define the name of a Java property and give it a value.  See the java
command for details.  The syntax for this argument is the same as that
defined for the similarly named option for the
.B java
command.  While the
.B \-\-resourcePath
option is more convenient, one use of this option that should be
mentioned occurs when the
.B org.bzdev.anim2d
package is used: to include images in untrusted scripts, one can add a
property whose name is
.B org.bzdev.protocols.resource.path
and whose value is one or more directories or URLs containing images, separated
by "|". Then the images can be accessed by using the
.B resource
URL.
The
properties "java.system.class.loader", "java.security.manager",
"scrunner.sysconf", and "scrunner.usrconf" cannot be altered by this
option (or the corresponding
.B \-J
option).  If those must be changed, add a
.B \-D
option before the
.B \-jar
option in the
.B scrunner
shell script (or alternatively, create a new script).
.TP
.BI \-d: VAR\ DIRNAME
.TQ
.BI \-d: VAR\fB:\fIDIRNAME
Binds a scripting language variable named
.I VAR
to a directory accessor (an instance of org.bzdev.io.DirectoryAccessor)
for the directory
.IR DIRNAME .
The directory accessor allows one to read and create files in
.I DIRNAME
or a subdirectory of
.I DIRNAME
using methods described in the DirectoryAccessor documentation.
.TP
.B \-\-dryrun
Prints the java command that would be executed but does not actually
execute it.
.TP
.B \-\-exit
When the scripts provided as arguments to scrunner have been run and
if there are no exceptions that have not been caught, scrunner will
exit with a status of 0.  Without this option, scrunner will not exit
if currently running threads have not run to completion. This is not
done by default because a script may have configured GUI components
(e.g., to display a graph).  When the scripts
.B scrunner
executes will not have any additional threads running after the scripts
run to completion, this option may noticeable improve performance,
particularly for short scripts.
.TP
.BI \-i: VAR\ \fIFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-i: VAR\fB:\fIFILENAME
Opens
.I FILENAME
for reading and defines a script variable
.I VAR
bound to the input stream for that file.
.TP
.BI \-J \-JOPTION
Causes a single-argument option
.I \-JOPTION
to be used by the java launcher that
.B scrunner
invokes.
.TP
.BI \-L\  LANGUAGE
Specifies the scripting language
.I LANGUAGE
 in use.
.TP
.B \-\-listScriptingLanguages\ [\fILANGUAGE\fB]...
Lists the available scripting languages when no languages are provided,
using the languages standard name.
When
.I LANGUAGE
is provided (perhaps multiple times) additional details about the language
are listed including file-name extensions, and aliases for the language.
This must be the first and only option when used. If only a single language
is provided, and that language is not supported,
.B scrunner
terminates with an exit code of 1, which  is useful in shell scripts and
makefiles for determining if a specific language is supported.
.TP
.BI \-\-module\-path\  PATH
.TQ
.BI \-p\  PATH
Add a colon-separated list of directories or modular JAR files to
the module path.  This option may appear multiple times. While the
path separator is a colon on Linux/Unix systems, it is a semicolon
on Windows systems.  Unlike the
.B \-\-codebase
option, a component of the path may not be a URL. Whether to use a
.B \-p
option or a
B. \-\-codebase
option is a matter of style.  One might prefer  the
.B \-p
option when the module path contains directories. Unlike Java, multiple
.B \-p
or
.B \-\-module-path
options may be provided. If so, the paths are combined.
.TP
.BI \-o\  OUTPUTFILE
Specify a file
.I OUTPUTFILE
for output from scripts.  A value of "\-" indicates standard output,
which is the default. Standard output can be specified only once for
the "\fB\-o\fR" and "\fB\-o:\fR" options.
.TP
.BI \-o: VAR\ \fIFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-o: VAR\fB:\fIFILENAME
Opens
.I FILENAME
for writing and defines a script variable
.I VAR
bound to the output stream for that file.  If
.I FILENAME
is "\fB\-\fR", standard output is used.  Standard output can be specified
only once for the "\fB\-o\fR" and "\fB\-o:\fR" options.
.TP
.BI \-\-plaf\  PLAF
Configures a a pluggable look and feel.  The argument
.I PLAF
can be the fully qualified class name for the look and feel or
the strings
.B system
(for the system look and field) )or
.B java
(for the default java look and feel). The documentation for the java class
javax.swing.UIManager contains examples of valid class names.
.TP
.B \-r
Maximize the quality of the random number generator provided by
org.bzdev.util.StaticRandom.
.TP
.BI \-\-resourcePath\  URLPATH
Specifies a search path for directories and jar files for URLs whose scheme is
"resource". Such URLs will be resolved against each directory or jar
file in the path, in the specified order, until a match is found.
.I URLPATH
may be a URL giving the location of the classes or a path name in the
local file system.  The character "|" is used as a separator so that
multiple URLs can appear in the same argument.  The sequence "||" is
interpreted as a literal "|", so that for an odd number of "|"
characters in a row, only the final one is treated as a path
separator.  If file name must start with "|", use a "file" URL and
encode the "|" as %7C.  If the starting sequence of a path component
contains a ":" (the first one if there are more than one), and that
sequence of characters is syntactically valid at the start of a URL,
the path component is treated as a URL. Otherwise it is a file name.
This rule implies that Windows file names such as C:mycode.jar will be
confused with a URL, so a URL should be used instead.  If a file name
is not absolute, it is interpreted relative to the current working
directory. Multiple
.B \-\-resourcePath
options may be provided (to improve readability).  For file names, a
leading "~" followed by the name separator ("/" for Unix) is expanded
to the user\'s home directory, a file name consisting of only "~" is
replaced with the user\'s home directory, and a leading "~~" is
replaced with "~". Finally, the substitutions for \'|\' and \'~\'
(followed by the file-name separator) do not apply to file-name
arguments that appear after the last option.
.TP
.BI \-r: VARNAME\ IFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-rw: VARNAME\ IFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-rws: VARNAME\ IFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-rwd: VARNAME\ IFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-r: VARNAME\fB:\fIFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-rw: VARNAME\fB:\fIFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-rws: VARNAME\fB:\fIFILENAME
.TQ
.BI \-rwd: VARNAME\fB:\fIFILENAME
Assign a random access file to the scripting-language variable
.IR VARNAME .
The object created will be an instance of java.io.RandomAccessFile,
constructed using a file
.I FILENAME
and a mode that is either
.BR r ,
.BR rw ,
.BR rs ,
or
.B rd .
.TP
.B \-\-stackTrace
Print a stack trace if an error occurs when running scripts.
.TP
.B \-\-supportsLanguage\ \fILANGUAGE\fB
Exit with exit code 0 if the scripting language
.I LANGUAGE
is supported and with exit code 1 if
.I LANGUAGE
is not supported.  This option is provided to simply writing shell
scripts that can test if a particular scripting language is supported.
The name
.I LANGUAGE
must be the standard name for the language, not an alias.
.TP
.B \-\-trustLevel=\fIN\fB
The value
.I N
can be 0 (the default), 1, or 2.  When 0, after command-line arguments
are processes, the Java security manager (java.lang.SecurityManager) will
be installed. When 1, the security manager
(org.bzdev.scripting.ScriptingSecurityManager) will be installed so that
Java code will be trusted but scripts will not be trusted (nor java code
called from a script).  When 2, no security manager will be installed.
.TP
.BI \-t \ FILE
Treat
.I File
as trusted (as described above), and end the options.
.TP
.BI \-vS: VAR\ VALUE
.TQ
.BI \-vS: VAR\fB:\fIVALUE
Set the variable
.I VAR
to the string
.IR VALUE .
.TP
.BI \-vB: VAR\ VALUE
.TQ
.BI \-vB: VAR\fB:\fIVALUE
Set the variable
.I VAR
to the boolean
.IR VALUE ,
which must have the values
.B true
or
.BR false .
.TP
.BI \-vI: VAR\ VALUE
.TQ
.BI \-vI: VAR\fB:\fIVALUE
Set the variable
.I VAR
to the number
.IR VALUE ,
which is treated as an integer.
.I VALUE
may be followed (with no intermediate spaces) by the letters 'h' (hecto), 'k'
(kilo), 'M' (mega), or 'G' (giga), which multiply the value by 
1000, 1,000,000, or 1,000,000,000 respectively.
.TP
.BI \-vL: VAR\ VALUE
.TQ
.BI \-vL: VAR\fB:\fIVALUE
Set the variable
.I VAR
to the number
.IR VALUE ,
which is treated as a long integer.
.I VALUE
may be followed (with no intermediate spaces) by the 
letters 'h' (hecto) 'k' (kilo), 'M' (mega), 'G' (giga), 'T' (tera), 'P'
(peta), or 'E' (exa), which multiply
.I VALUE
by 100, 1000, 1,000,000, 1e9, 1e12, 1e15, 1e18 respectively.
.TP
.BI \-vD: VAR\ VALUE
.TQ
.BI \-vD: VAR\fB:\fIVALUE
Set the variable
.I VAR
to the number
.IR VALUE ,
which is treated as a double-precision floating-point number.
.I VALUE
may be followed (with no intermediate spaces) by the
letters 'y' (yocto), 'z' (zepto), 'a' (atto), 'f' (femto), 'p'
(pica), 'n' (nano), 'u' (micro), 'm' (milli), 'c' (centi), 'h'
(hecto), 'k' (kilo), 'M' (mega), 'G' (giga), 'T' (tera), 'P'
(peta), 'E' (exa), 'Z' (zetta), or 'Y' (yotta), which multiply
.I VALUE
by 1.0e\-24, 1.0e\-21, 1.0e\-18, 1.0e\-15, 1.0e\-12, 1.0e\-9, 1.0e\-6,
1.0e\-3, 1.0e\-3, 1.0e2, 1.0e3, 1.0e6, 1.0e9, 1.0e12, 1.0e15, 1.0e18,
1.0e21 or 1.e24 respectively.
.TP
.B \-\-versions
Print the URL of each JAR file in
.BR scrunner \'s
class path, including entries added via the
.BR \-\-codebase
option, followed by an indented line containing the specification version
for the JAR file and then the implementation version.  If either is
missing, a "\-" is printed in its place.
.SH EXECUTABLE SCRIPTS
.PP
The
.B scrunner
command can be used for making ESP scripts executable. Suppose a
script is placed in a file name
.B testscript
and
.B testscript
starts with the following line:
.IP
 #!/usr/bin/scrunner -s:D:a,D:b,E:true
.br
global.getWriter()println(a + b);.
.PP
On Unix/Linux systems, executable files that start with the sequence
.IP
.B #!\fIPATHNAME
.PP
will run the program specified by
.I PATHNAME
with the pathname of the script as its argument, possibly following a
single options. The result is that, if
.B testscript
is executable, then running the command
.IP
 ./testscript 10 20
.PP
is equivalent to running
.IP
 scrunner -s:D:a,D:b,E:true testscript 10 20
.PP
which in turn is equivalent to
.IP
 scrunner -vD:a:10 -vD:b:20 --exit testscript
.PP
which prints the value 30.
Additional scripts can be added to the command:
.IP
 ./testscript 10 20 foo.esp
.PP
will print 30 on one line and then run the script
.BR foo.esp .
Additional
.B scrunner
options can be added. For example
.IP
 ./testscript --dryrun 10 20 foo.esp
.PP
will print the Java command that is actually executed. These Options can, of
course add additional arguments such as a directory accessor.
.PP
The following 8-line-long program (on Linux systems):
.IP
#!/usr/bin/scrunner -s:D:a,D:b,E:true
import (java.lang.Math);
import (org.bzdev.math.Functions);
function circE (a, b) {
    var e2 = (a*a - b*b)/(a*a);
    (e2 < 0)? circE(b, a): 4*a*eE(sqrt(e2))
}
global.getWriter().println(circE(a,b));
.PP
will use an ESP script to print the circumference of an ellipse given
the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes.

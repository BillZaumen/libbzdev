To create modules.svg, run

   dia modules.dia

and export the file as modules.png and as modules.svg .  Then run

    epts modules.epts

if needed (to change the lines showing module dependencies).  Next run

    epts modules.eptt

and change the line widths, etc. as desired, and then use the final
tab to create an output file (overlay.svg).

Finally, open modules.svg and overlay.svg .  In overlay.svg, modify
the lines so that they have arrows at the end (epts does not do that).
Scale the images if necessary and put the lines in overlay.svg on top
of the text in modules.svg, then save the combination as modules.svg .

If modules.epts is not available, start epts and open the file
modules.png .  epts will allow you to draw lines showing the
dependencies.  Save it as modules.epts .

If epts cannot open modules.epts, either modules.png is missing or has
changed size.  If it changed size, but not by too much, you can edit
modules.epts - it is an XML file and adjust the fields specifying the
image size.

Another option is to take modules.svg as generated by dia and edit it
with your favorite graphics program to add the dependencies (the
author found that the program epts made drawing the lines easier than
drawing them using inkscape).

EPTS hint: epts allows one to create paths that are the composite of
multiple lines. This is often used to give the lines the same width or
color, and to create regions to fill, perhaps with holes in them.  The
catch is that graphics editors such as inkscape will interpret the
composite as a single path so putting an arrow at the end will change
the last line segment alone. To prevent this, set the properties for
each segment separately.

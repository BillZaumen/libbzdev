<H3><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</H3>

The class {@link Model3D} creates 3D images.  The images consist of a
set of triangles in which the order of the vertices determines the
direction of a normal vector pointing outwards, based on the
right-hand rule.  In addition, a vertex must not intersect an edge
unless it terminates the edge. One can create triangles directly by
calling {@link Model3D} methods named addTriangle: {@link
Model3D#addTriangle(Triangle)}, {@link
Model3D#addTriangle(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double)},
{@link
Model3D#addTriangle(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,java.awt.Color)},
{@link
Model3D#addTriangle(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,java.awt.Color)},
and {@link
Model3D#addTriangle(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,java.awt.Color,Object)},
There are similar methods named addFlippedTriangle that reverse the
triangle's orientation given the same arguments.  One can also call
the {@link Model3D} method {@link Model3D#addModel(Model3D)} or {@link
Model3D#addModel(Model3D,Object)} to import all the triangles from
another model.  One can additionally set transforms to modify the
objects being created.  For example, if a model contains a circular
disk, one can set a transform to change the scale in (for example) the
Y direction so that the imported object will be an elliptical
disk. Details are provided in the documentation for the methods {@link
Model3D#pushParms()} and {@link
Model3D#pushTransform(org.bzdev.geom.Transform3D)}.
<P>
The class {@link BinarySTLParser}
adds objects to a {@link Model3D} by reading the
objects from an external source with the objects encoded using the
STL standard.  The external source may be a file or input stream.
This can be done in order to create an image or animation of a
model, but also to re-use a model for which only an STL file is
available.
<P>
For 3D printing, the triangles must form a closed, two dimensional
manifold that is embedded in a Euclidean 3 dimensional space. That
is, the surfaces must not have an edge and the surfaces must not
intersect themselves.  Each edge must be in precisely two
triangles, and using the vertex (node) ordering, the edge must be
traversed in each direction only once.
<P>
Methods exist for creating models, verifying that models are
2D manifolds embedded in a three dimensional space, rendering
images of models and writing files.  The class Model3D.Image
provides a subclass of BufferedImage with support for 3D models
including the ability to rotate and translate images and positioning
a light source.
<P>
A typical use of this package is as follows:
<OL>
  <LI> One will create an instance of Model3D
       (the constructor does not take any arguments). For
       debugging, one may wish to call the method
       {@link Model3D#setStackTraceMode(boolean)}
       with the argument <code>true</code> so that each triangle is
       tagged with the stack traces that exists when that triangle was
       created.  This may be done selectively.
  <LI> One will then call the method
       {@link Model3D#addTriangle(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double)}
       repeatedly to create the triangles that  make up the model.
       The orientation of this triangle is determined by a right-hand rule
       with the direction implied by the rule pointing outwards from the
       surface (i.e., the 2D manifold that the model creates).
       The corresponding method
       {@link Model3D#addFlippedTriangle(double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double,double)}
       can be used when the orientation of a triangle should be
       reversed. One may also add a line segment, which will appear in
       images as a reference line but are not included when a 3D model
       is written to an output file.  Methods also exist for adding a
       previously created model.
  <LI> One should then verify the model by using the methods
       {@link Model3D#verifyClosed2DManifold()} and
       {@link Model3D#verifyEmbedded2DManifold()}.
       As a short cut, one can use the methods
       {@link Model3D#printable()},
       {@link Model3D#printable(Appendable)},
       {@link Model3D#notPrintable()}, and
       {@link Model3D#notPrintable(Appendable)}
       to combine the two 'verify' methods and to handle the display
       of error messages (for those with an argument).
  <LI> To generate an image of a model, first create an instance of
       {@link Model3D.Image}. Its constructors are
       modeled after
       those used by java.awt.image.BufferedImage, but one
       may also provide a
       {@link org.bzdev.graphs.Graph} whose
       buffered image or output-stream graphics will be used, or
       one can provide an instance of
       {@link org.bzdev.gio.OutputStreamGraphics} as this class
       will allow various image types, including postscript, to be
       used.
  <LI> To generate an animation of the model, showing it in various
    orientations, create an animation and then an instance of
    {@link Model3DView} associated with that
    animation.  The documentation
    for {@link Model3DView} describes how
    this class is used to create animations.
  <LI> To create an output file for 3D printing, use the Model3D methods named
    writeSTL (for STL files) or writeX3D (for X3D files):
    <UL>
      <LI> {@link Model3D#writeSTL(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)}
      <LI> {@link Model3D#writeSTL(java.lang.String,java.io.OutputStream)}
      <LI> {@link Model3D#writeSTL(java.lang.String,java.io.File)}
      <LI> {@link Model3D#writeSTL(java.lang.String,java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel)}
      <LI> {@link Model3D#writeX3D(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)}
      <LI> {@link Model3D#writeX3D(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.io.OutputStream)}
      <LI> {@link Model3D#writeX3D(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.io.File)}
    </UL>
    By default, X3D files are configured so that dimensions are
    represented in millimeters.  For other units, use the method
    {@link Model3D#setUnitScaleX3D(double)}.  There are some
    additional writeX3D methods that are not shown: these allow one to
    specify the use of an X3D 'full' profile and request the use of
    file compression.
  <LI> To obtain information about a model, use the following methods:
       <UL>
          <LI>{@link Model3D#size()} to count
              the number of triangles in the model.
          <LI>{@link Model3D#volume()} to
	    determine the volume of a model.
          <LI>{@link Model3D#area()} to
              determine the surface area of a model.
          <LI>{@link Model3D#numberOfComponents()}
              to count the number of components (disjoint surfaces) in
              a model.
          <LI>{@link Model3D#notHollow()} to
              determine that a model is not hollow.
       </UL>
  <LI> To handle some common cases, the class P3d and its inner
    classes provide utility methods that handle special cases
    (e.g., rectangles, so that a single call will produce all of
    the triangles for a rectangle). Other classes such
    as {@link SteppedGrid} and {@link SteppedGrid.Builder} make it easier
    to construct models that fit particular design patterns.

The following program, which uses {@link SteppedGrid.Builder}
to simplify constructing a 3D model, will create a file suitable for a 3D
printer and will provide a sequence of images showing the object from
various viewpoints:

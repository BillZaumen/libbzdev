  <H1>Secure Basic Authentication</H1>
  <P> 
    <STRONG>Basic Access Authentication</STRONG> and a more secure
    variant named <STRONG>Digest Access Authentication</STRONG>, are
    described in RFC 2617, which discusses the security issues with
    both, including MITM (Man In The Middle) attacks.
  <P>
    Secure Basic authentication combines the simplicity of Basic
    authentication with the security provided by public-key
    cryptography.  Simplicity is achieved by eliminating the need for
    a server to explicitly send a challenge as is done by SSH or FIDO
    when public-key authentication is used.  Instead, a passphrase is
    computed, using a combination of time stamps and public key
    encryption, and verified by the server.  Secure basic
    authentication assumes that SSL/TLS will be used for connections
    between a client and server. As a result,
    <UL>
      <LI> when a connection is first established, a client will receive
	a certificate from the server. This certificate is valid for at
	least the duration of the connection.
      <LI> the certificate is used to verify that the server to which
	the client has connected in fact has the private key corresponding
	to the public key stored in the certificate.
      <LI> servers are implemented so that the private keys are kept
	securely.  As a result, any attempt a phishing or spoofing will
	require the use of a different certificate, and specifically a
	different public key.
    </UL>
    The passphrase that secure basic authentication uses is
    generated by signing a time stamp and the server's certificate's
    public key  along with some additional information. This requires
    that the server's and client's clocks are synchronized, but that is
    easily done given that most systems use NTP (Network Time Protocol).
    Once verified, this password can be used for a more extended
    period.  If that period expired, a new passphrase is
    generated and revalidated.
  <P>
    The passphrase generated in Secure Basic authentication uses
    <UL>
      <LI> a private key corresponding to the public key that will
	be stored on a server.
      <LI> a user-supplied password that will be stored on the server.
      <LI> the current time.  For clarity, in the following text, this
	password will be referred to as the "password" and the one
	generated by using public key encryption will be referred to as
	the "passphrase".
    </UL>
    The passphrase contains several fields:
    <UL>
      <LI> a 4-octet field containing a timestamp consisting of a
	32-bit two's complement integer, stored in little-endian byte
	order, providing the time the passphrase was created. The time
	is given by the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
      <LI> a 4-octet field containing a 32-bit CRC of the first four
	octets and a UTF-8 encoded password in that order, stored in
	little-endian byte order. For a denial of service attack with
	random passwords, the CRC will reduce the number of digital
	signatures that have to verified by a server by a factor of
	approximately 4 billion.
      <LI> a digital signature of
	<UL>
	  <LI> the first 8 octets of the passphrase,
	  <LI> the DER encoding of the certificate's public key,
	  <LI> the UTF-8 encoded password used in the CRC,
	</UL>
	created using the user's private key and signature algorithm.
    </UL>
    This sequence of octets is then base-64 encoded using the URL-safe
    encoding described in RFC 4648 to create the passphrase that will be
    sent to the server.
  <P>
    The server stores the user's public key, signature algorithm, and
    password. To check that a passphrase is valid, the server
    <UL>
      <LI> decodes the passphrase using a base-64 decoder for the
	URL-safe encoding,
      <LI> checks the timestamp stored in the first four octets
	(octets 1 to 4),
      <LI> uses the first 4 octets and the stored password in that
	order to compute a 32-bit CRC and compares that to the one
	corresponding to the value stored in octets 5 to 8,
      <LI> uses the public key and signature algorithm to verify that
	the signature stored in the remaining octets (starting with
	octet 9) is valid for a document consisting of
	<UL>
	  <LI> octets 1 to 8,
	  <LI> the server's SSL certificate's public key represented
	    by its DER encoding,
	  <LI> the UTF-8 encoded password.
	</UL>
    </UL>
    If these tests do not fail, authorization succeeds and the
    passphrase can be stored in a table of verified passphrases with a key
    given by the user's name and Internet address. This table also
    includes an expiration time for the user and address specified by
    the key, which is updated each time the key provided the
    expiration time has not been reached.  If the expiration time has
    been passed, the authentication fails and the user must generate a
    new passphrase.
  <P>
    In addition to providing some protection against denial of service
    attacks, The password is useful when certificates use
    subject alternative names, effectively allowing multiple entities
    to share a single certificate, and where one may want to be logged
    into one entity but not another.
  <P>
    Typically a client will reuse a passphrase that it has previously
    generated until that passphrase fails.  It that is done, the client
    should also  check that the corresponding certificate has not been
    changed: otherwise a MITM attack is possible, although that would
    require compromising the network infrastructure (routers, DNS servers,
    etc.)

    A program, <STRONG>sbl</STRONG>, will generate passphrases
    and copy them to the clipboard so that they can be pasted
    into a dialog box provided by a browser that does not support
    secure basic authentication.

    <H2>Realms</H2>
  <P>
    Basic authentication defines a "realm" as a name used to define
    a "protection space" (as defined in RFC 7235, Section 2.2
    Secure basic authentication uses a stylized encoding for realms: if
    a realm sent by a server to a client starts with
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>[D]</STRONG>, a form of digest authentication is used:
	the passphrase is the URL-safe base64 encoding of the first 8
	octets as described above, followed by a SHA-256
	message digest of those 8 octets and the UTF-8 encoded
	password in that order. This option is provided primarily for
	testing.
      <LI><STRONG>[S]</STRONG>, the digital signature described above
	does not include the public key from the server certificate.
	This option is provided for testing or if for some
	reason SSL cannot be used and security is not a major concern.
      <LI><STRONG>[SC]</STRONG>, the digital signature is computed as
	described above.
    </UL>
    Otherwise basic authentication is assumed.  The class
    org.bzdev.swing.AuthenticationPane replaces "[D]", "[S]", and
    "[SC]" with sequences of one or more emoji when creating a prompt
    to display.  The emoji are used as icons.

    <H2>Timestamps and timeouts</H2>
  <P>
    A server should support the following limits and timeouts
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>lowerTimeDiffLimit</STRONG>. This value must be
	negative. It is added to the current time to get a lower bound
	on the timestamp encoded in the first 4 octets of a passphrase.
	It is negative to account for clocks being slightly out of
	synchronization. The value is in units of seconds.
      <LI><STRONG>upperTimeDiffLimit</STRONG>. This value must not be
	negative. It is added to the current time to get an upper bound
	on the timestamp encoded in the first 4 octets of a passphrase.
	Its value should be large enough to allow for delay and
	processing time in addition to errors in clock synchronization.
	The value is in units of seconds.
      <LI><STRONG>passphraseTimeout</STRONG>. Once a passphrase has been
	authenticated, the passphrase will typically be kept in a table
	that maps a given user name and Internet address to a passphrase
	and expiration time.  The expiration time will be the sum of
	the current time and the value of
	<STRONG>passphraseTimeout</STRONG>, both in units of seconds.
	If a new authorization request arrives before the expiration
	time for the same user and Internet address, the corresponding
	expiration time is reset to the sum of the new current time
	and the value of
	<STRONG>passphraseTimeout</STRONG>.
    </UL>
  <P>
    The use of timestamps prevents old passphrases from being reused,
    even though, with SSL/TLS, it would be very difficult to obtain one.

    <H2>Key pairs</H2>

    Key pairs and signature algorithms are those that Java supports.
    The default uses elliptic key cryptography.  The elliptic curve
    is <STRONG>secp256r1</STRONG> (openssl prefers the name
    <STRONG>prime256v1</STRONG>, which keytool does not accept). The
    default signature algorithm is <STRONG>SHA256withECDSA</STRONG>.

    <H2>Ease of implementation</H2>

    Secure basic authentication is easy to implement, primarily
    because basic-authentication code is reused.  The following
    classes were added to the BZDev class library to support
    secure basic authentication:
    <UL>
      <LI><STRONG>org.bzdev.net.PemDecoder</STRONG>: 227 lines of
	code.  This is a general-purpose class for decoding PEM files.
	It uses a utility class (org.bzdev.net.HeaderOps) that
	contains 371 lines of code).
      <LI><STRONG>org.bzdev.net.PemEncoder</STRONG>: 79 lines of code.
	This is a general-purpose class for encoding PEM files.
      <LI><STRONG>org.bzdev.net.SecureBasicUtilities</STRONG>: 520
	lines of code. This class contains the code for creating and
	verifying passphrases, and for some other useful operations. It
	contains methods used by both a client and a server and can
	generate key pairs. It also contains methods that allow
	passphrases to be represented in a series of format: strings,
	arrays of char, and arrays of bytes, so there is more code
	than would be needed by a single application.
      <LI><STRONG>org.bzdev.ejws.EjwsSecureBasicAuth</STRONG>: 483
	lines of code, compared to 184 lines of code for
	org.bzdev.ejws.EjwsBasicAuthenticator, which provides an
	implementation of basic authentication.  The class
	EjwsSecureBasicAuth contains server-specific code for the web
	server provided by the org.bzdev.ejws package.  If a private
	key is GPG encrypted, this class will use GPG to decrypt the
	private key (the advantage is that GPG agent will then prompt
	for the appropriate password, etc., needed to decrypt the
	key).
      <LI><STRONG>org.bzdev.swing.AuthenticationPane</STRONG>: 558
	lines of code.  This contains the code needed to create a
	dialog box to get a user name and password. It works with
	secure basic authentication, digest authentication, and basic
	authentication.
    </UL>
    The number of lines of code were estimated using a program that
    ignores comments and blank lines, but counts everything else including
    Java import statements and lines that contain as little as a single
    brace. As a result the number of lines of code listed for each case
    is an overestimate of the number of executable statements.
  <P>
    Implementing secure basic authentication in a browser should be
    roughly comparable to implementing or modifying a password manager.

    <H2>Implementation limitations</H2>
  <P>
    The current implementation has two limitations, mostly because
    of the existing Java APIs:
    <UL>
      <LI> The client will open a separate SSL connection to the
        server to get the certificate because the Java APIs do not
        provide a convenient way of getting the certificate for the
        connection an authenticator is using.
      <LI> When a passphrase is cached an SSL connection's certificate is
	not checked to verify that it is the one used to generate the
	password. While it is a trivial change, it would require modifying
	classes that are part of the JRE.

    Successfully verifying these passphrases requires that that the
    public key can verify a signature constructed using the user's
    password and the server's certificate, and two different servers
    cannot use the same certificate sharing the certificate's private
    key.

    These, of course, are periodically updated. Regardless, a useful
    exercise for a reader so inclined is to try to create new
    passphrases that can be verified with either certificate, given
    the public key and password provided above&mdash;a task that would
    have to break public key encryption in order to succeed.

This directory contains two scripts used to maintain the image
maps in the file description.html.  The first script is named
editMap and is used to edit image maps (adjusting the area on
the map that is active for each URL in the map)

    ./editMap
	Edit the image map for the 'modules' image map in overview.html

    ./editMap modules2
        Edit the image map for 'modules2' in description.html

    ./editMap base
        Edit the image map for 'base' in description.html

    ./editMap desktop
        Edit the image map for 'desktop' in description.html

    ./editMap devqsim
        Edit the image map for 'devqsim' in description.html

    ./editMap drama
        Edit the image map for 'drama' in description.html

    ./editMap ejws
        Edit the image map for 'ejws' in description.html

    ./editMap graphics
        Edit the image map for 'graphics' in description.html

    ./editMap math
        Edit the image map for 'math' in description.html

    ./editMap rest
        Edit the image map for 'rest' in description.html

The .editMap command starts the program epts with appropriate arguments.

The next step uses the script createMap to create image maps for a specified
case:

    ./createMap
	Create a map for 'modules' to be placed in the file overview.html

    ./createMap modules2
    	Create a map for 'modules2' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap base
    	Create a map for 'base' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap desktop
    	Create a map for 'desktop' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap devqsim
    	Create a map for 'devqsim' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap drama
    	Create a map for 'drama' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap ejws
    	Create a map for 'ejws' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap graphics
    	Create a map for 'graphics' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap math
    	Create a map for 'math' to be placed in the file description.html

    ./createMap rest
    	Create a map for 'rest' to be placed in the file description.html
	(this contains a map listing the modules that contain a single
	package).

The createMap script will print the map on standard output, and that can
be easily pasted into the appropriate HTML file.

Both scripts use the program epts (an application that uses this class library)
to edit and generate the image maps.

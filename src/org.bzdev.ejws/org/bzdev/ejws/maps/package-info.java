/**
 * Mapping classes to support EJWS classes.

 * These classes map the path components of URLs to a
 * descriptor that allows the objects named by a URL to be read.
 * The descriptor will provide an input stream, mime types, and
 * object lengths in bytes.  The object may be stored somewhere
 * in the local files system or may be obtained from a different
 * server, depending on the map class used.

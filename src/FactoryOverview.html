    <P>
      The adjacent frame contains a menu of factory names for
      factories in the
      <A HREF="../index.html" target="_top">BZDev class library</A>.
      These factories are provided by the following packages.
      <UL>
	<LI> <CODE><A HREF="../org.bzdev.anim2d/org/bzdev/anim2d/package-summary.html#package_description">
	      org.bzdev.anim2d</A></CODE>. The factories in this
	  package create various animation objects.
	<LI> <CODE><A HREF="../org.bzdev.devqsim/org/bzdev/devqsim/package-summary.html#package_description">
	      org.bzdev.devqsim</A></CODE>. The factories in this
	  package support various types of queues, a  class used for
	  tracing a simulation's execution, and a class
	  (ProcessClockFactory) that can be used to represent CPU time.
	<LI> <CODE><A HREF="../org.bzdev.drama/org/bzdev/drama/package-summary.html#package_description">
	      org.bzdev.drama</A></CODE>. The factories in this class
	  support actor-based (or agent-based) simulations by allowing
	  one to create domains and various types of conditions.
	  Packages based on the <CODE>org.bzdev.drama</CODE> will
	  have factories for particular types of agents.
	<LI> <CODE><A HREF="../org.bzdev.p3d/org/bzdev/p3d/package-summary.html#package_description">
	      org.bzdev.p3d</A></CODE>. This package contains a
	  single factory, used for creating animations of a 3D model
	  that can be moved, rotated so that the model can be easily
	  viewed from various directions.  The intention is to provide
	  a design aid, not to render the image realistically.
      </UL>
      The factories are grouped according to their packages.

      for the corresponding factory.

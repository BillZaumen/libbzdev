This package provides the basic mechanisms needed for scheduling
calls and tasks, managing simulation time, and for queuing
calls and tasks.  Calls are instances of the interface
org.bzdev.lang.Callable, which provides a method with no argument
and no return value named call().  Typically a Callable is implemented
using an anonymous class.  Tasks are represented by threads. For threads
associated with a simulation, only one thread will run at a time.
<P>
The Simulation class handles the scheduling of events where a
specific time to wait is given.  It also manages a name space for
all instances of SimulationObject, so that objects used in a
simulation can be referenced via string giving the object's name.
In addition, the class Simulation allows the user to schedule calls
and tasks implemented as scripts. To enable scripting, the user
must implement the protected methods getScriptEngine and
getScriptLanguage, inherited from the class
org.bzdev.scripting.ScriptingContext.  The user should implement
the protected method getDefaultBindings(). Additional
<P>
The following diagram shows a high-level view of the structure of
this package, except for "factory" classes, emphasizing the classes
used to write simulations:

<P>
A Callable can be scheduled directly.  For a task thread, one normally
schedules a Runnable and the simulation will then create the task thread.
The subclasses of DefaultSimObject shown in the diagram above have
implementations that interact with the Simulation's event queue, and
allow tasks and instances of Callable to be put onto queues and processed
in a queue-specific order.  The ProcessClock class is used to handle the
case in which a single entity interleaves several activities but can only
do one at a time - this is similar to what happens when multiple threads
run on a single CPU.
<P>
When a simulation is run, one may either specify the duration for
which it is run or one can implement the interface SimulationMonitor
to determine dynamically when a simulation should stop. In addition,
a SimulationListener can be added to the simulation, which responds
to instances of SimulationStateEvent, used to indicate what the
simulation is currently doing.  A SimulationListener may be used for
debugging, but it can also be used if a GUI needs to track a simulation
for purposes of updating the contents of a window.  These classes and
how they interact is shown in the following figure:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="monitoring.png" class="imgBackground">
<P>
The class DefaultSimAdapter implements SimulationListener but
provide defaults to make it easy to write a listener that responds
to particular types of events.  The class DefaultSimAdapter also
allows its behavior to be specified via scripts.
<P>
In addition, it is possible to tag events with a stack trace relevant
to when the event was created.  This is a relatively expensive operation,
and should normally be disabled (it is by default), but can be useful
for debugging.  It is handled by the method
{@link Simulation#setStackTraceMode(boolean)}.
<P>
The implementation of the Simulation class uses instances of the
class SimulationEvent to handle scheduling events, whether events
associated with a Callable, a TaskThread, a queue, or events
defined by packages that implement extensions of the current
package for specific kinds of simulations.  The class hierarchy for
simulation events is shown in the following figure:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="events.png" class="imgBackground">
<ul>
  <li> The class {@link SimulationEvent}
    can be subclassed to add more types of events.  This is done in
    the org.bzdev.drama and org.bzdev.drama.generic packages to allows
    simulation objects called actors to send messages to each other.
  <li> The
    class {@link TaskSimulationEvent}
    is the common superclass for scheduling method calls (via
    instances of the class org.bzdev.lang.Callable) and instances of
    TaskThread (the class that handles Simulation-specific threads).
  <li> The class TaskObjectSimEvent is not public, and is used to schedule
    a Callable and in the creation of an unscheduled TaskThread.
  <li> {@link TaskThreadSimEvent}
    handles the case of a TaskThread pausing
    for some amount of simulation time.
  <li> {@link TaskQueueSimEvent}
    allows a TaskThread or a Callable to be placed on a TaskQueue.  It
    is used internally as queues used to store instances of TaskThread
    and Callable have elements of this type, but the class is public
    so that other packages can create subclasses of TaskQueue. The
    constructor, however, is not public.
 <li> TaskQueuePauseSimEvent is not public and is used when a running
      task that is being serviced by the queue has pause, but without
      freeing resources that would allow another queued task to run.
</ul>
<P>
Simulations may have a parent.  The parent must be a scripting context
(the class {@link org.bzdev.devqsim.Simulation} extends
{@link org.bzdev.scripting.ScriptingContext})
and the case in which a parent is itself a Simulation is treated
specially.  When a simulation has a parent, the parent's scripting
context is shared by the simulation's scripting context: both use the
same script engine and default bindings unless explicitly overridden.
When the parent is a simulation, the parent's event queue is shared.
The parent's name space is also used to find simulation objects. One
use of a parent simulation occurs when one has an existing simulation
and would like to add an animation to it.  The org.bzdev.anim2d
package defines the Animation2D as a subclass of Simulation, so one
can constuct an Animation2D with a parent simulation. Since both
share the same event queue, one can easily generate animation frames
in sync with a simulation. This also helps keep the simulation code
separate from the animation code.
<P>
Factory classes can be used to configure simulation objects. The
class hierarchy is shown in the following diagram:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="dqfactories.png" class="imgBackground">
<P>
The class hierarchy follows the guidelines suggested for the
org.bzdev.obnaming package. where abstract factory classes with
type parameters follow the class hierarchy for the objects the
factories create, and non-abstract subclasses of these allow
objects to be created.
<H3><A NAME="examples"></A>Examples</H3>
As an example, the following program
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
import org.bzdev.devqsim.Simulation;
import org.bzdev.devqsim.TaskThread;

public class stest {
    public static void main(String argv[]) throws Exception {
	Simulation sim = new Simulation(1000.0);

	sim.scheduleCall(() -&gt; {
		System.out.println("time = " + sim.currentTime());
	    }, sim.getTicks(4.0));

	sim.scheduleCall(() -&gt; {
		System.out.println("time = " + sim.currentTime());
	    }, sim.getTicks(2.0));

	sim.scheduleTask(() -&gt; {
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
		    System.out.println("time = " + sim.currentTime());
		    TaskThread.pause(sim.getTicks(0.1));
		}
	    }, sim.getTicks(3.0));

	sim.run();
    }
}
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE></CODE>
will create a simulation that schedules several events. The scheduleCall
method's first argument is an object whose type is
{@link org.bzdev.lang.Callable}, which provides a single method named 'call'.
This interface is a functional interface, so the first argument for
schedulCall can be a lambda expression. The scheduleTask method's first
argument has the type {@link java.lang.Runnable} and is also a functional
method. It will schedule a task that will run in a separate thread, starting
at a particular simulation time. In the example, there is a loop that
prints a statement at successive times. The call to
{@link org.bzdev.devqsim.TaskThread#pause(long)} will make the thread wait
for a specified amount of simulation time.
<P>
The corresponding program when scripting is used is shown below. The
program must be run by using the scrunner command, which predefines
the variable <CODE>scripting</CODE>, an instance of
{@link org.bzdev.scripting.ExtendedScriptingContext}.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.devqsim.Simulation");
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.devqsim.TaskThread");

var out = scripting.getWriter();

sim = new Simulation(scripting, 1000.0);

sim.scheduleCall(function() {
    out.println("time = " + sim.currentTime());
}, sim.getTicks(4.0));

sim.scheduleCall(function() {
    out.println("time = " + sim.currentTime());
}, sim.getTicks(2.0));

sim.scheduleTaskObject(function() {
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
        out.println("time = " + sim.currentTime());
        TaskThread.pause(sim.getTicks(0.1));
    }
}, sim.getTicks(3.0));

sim.run();
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE></CODE>
Because of the use of a task thread, scrunner should use the
option <CODE>--trustLevel=2</CODE>.
<P>
More complex examples would define subclasses of
{@link org.bzdev.devqsim.SimObject}.  One can override the protected method
{@link org.bzdev.devqsim.SimObject#update(double,long)} if the object's
state is explicitly dependent on time so that every call to
{@link org.bzdev.devqsim.SimObject#update()} will change the object's
state to what it should be at the current simulation time.  One can
also create various queues and place instances of
{@link org.bzdev.lang.Callable}, {@link java.lang.Runnable}, or
{@link org.bzdev.devqsim.TaskThread} on them (for a TaskThread, placing
it on a queue automatically causes the thread to pause).
For example,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.devqsim.Simulation");
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.devqsim.TaskThread");

var out = scripting.getWriter();

sim = new Simulation(scripting, 1000.0);

sim.createFactories("org.bzdev.devqsim",
		    {fifof: "FifoTaskQueueFactory"});

var fifo = fifof.createObject("fifo");

sim.scheduleTask(function() {
    out.println("time for task = " + sim.currentTime());
    fifo.addCurrentTask(sim.getTicks(1.0));
    out.println("time for task = " + sim.currentTime());
    fifo.addCurrentTask(sim.getTicks(1.0));
    out.println("time for task = " + sim.currentTime());
    fifo.addCurrentTask(sim.getTicks(1.0));
    out.println("time for task = " + sim.currentTime());
});

var count = 0;
var callable = {
    call: function() {
	out.println("time for call = " + sim.currentTime());
	if (count++ == 3) return;
	fifo.addCallObject(callable, sim.getTicks(1.0));
    }
};

sim.scheduleCallObject(callable, 0.0);

sim.run();
</BLOCKQUOTE></PRE></CODE>
<P>
In this example, the call to <CODE>createFactories</CODE> creates a
factory named <CODE>fifof</CODE>. Its first argument is a package name
and its second argument is an ECMAScript object whose property keys
are treated as variable names and whose values are the simple class
name of a class in the package provided by its first argument. The
simulation task pauses when it calls the method
<CODE>addCurrentTask</CODE> and places itself on the queue
<CODE>fifo</CODE>. Similarly, the call to the
method <CODE>addCallObject</CODE> restarts the <CODE>Callable</CODE> that
invokes method <CODE>call</CODE> defined by the ECMAScript object
<CODE>callable</CODE> by queuing this <CODE>Callable</CODE> with a
specified service time. A test using the variable <CODE>count</CODE>
terminates the sequence.

<B>The BZDev class library</B>
<P>
The BZDev class library supports discrete-event simulation, graphs and
plotting, mathematical functions and numerical algorithms, 2D
animation, 3D printing, writing graphics to output streams,
integration of scripting with applications, additional Swing
components, etc. The library uses 'factory' classes for configuring
simulations and animations. An annotation processor makes it
relatively easy to create a factory class.  The code is partitioned
into several Java modules. The dependencies are shown in the following
graph (click on the module names as a shortcut):

<P>
All of these modules are dependent on the module org.bzdev.base, but
only some dependencies are shown explicitly to reduce clutter: just
enough so that the diagram will show at least an indirect dependency.
Two  modules, org.bzdev.dmethods and org.bzdev.parmproc, are not shown
as these are used only for annotation processing.

<B>and the following books:</B>
<UL>
  <LI>An introduction to the BZDev Java class library [in preparation].
    This book provides an overview of the classes provided by this library
    with coding examples.
  <LI>The ESP scripting language and its use with factory classes.
    [in preparation]
    This book describes the ESP scripting language, both its syntax and
    semantics, and shows how it is used with the factory classes provided
    by the BZDev class library. The book is an extended version of the
    <A HREF="org.bzdev.base/org/bzdev/util/doc-files/esp.html">
      ESP API documentation</A>. ESP is essentially a subset of ECMAScript
    with a few constructs borrowed from Java and with a few additional
    operators.  It was written because the Nashorn ECMAScript implementation
    has been removed from Java-15, and GraalVM does not support multithreading
    adequately for use with the BZDev library's simulation classes. One of
    the goals for ESP is stability: it can be used to configure simulations
    that may be re-run years after they were written.
  <LI>Programming BZDev named objects and their factories [in preparation].
    This book describes how to create named objects as defined in the
    BZDev class library, and how to create the factory classes that create
    named objects.
  <LI>A scripting guide for the org.bzdev.roadanim package [in preparation].
    The package org.bzdev.roadanim provides several classes that extend
    classes in the org.bzdev.anim2d package to support animations showing
    cars, bicycles, and pedestrians.  This guide provides an overview
    of these classes and specifically how to use them with the ESP
    scripting language.  The source code is available on
    <A HREF="https://github.com/BillZaumen/librdanim">GitHub<A>.
  <LI>A programmable bicycle-sharing simulation [in preparation].
    This book describes a simulation that provides a realistic test case
    for simulation classes provided by the BZDev class library. At the
    time it was written, a number of cities and towns in the U.S. were
    experimenting with bicycle-sharing programs.  The simulation shows
    that how these services were priced was at best dubious, so it is
    not surprising that many of these services had problems. The source
    code is available on
    <A HREF="https://github.com/BillZaumen/libbikeshr">GitHub</A>.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, several applications were written using the BZDev
class library. As they were written, classes that seemed to be
useful for other applications and that were a good match for those
already in the library were added to the library so they could be
shared with other applications.  These programs are
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>epts</STRONG>. This program is a graphics editor that
    creates and edits two types of objects: points and paths. It can
    also write a description of these objects to a file, using
    templates to specify the form of the output.  Built-in templates
    can create
    <UL>
      <LI>SVG files.
      <LI>ECMAScript/JavaScript files or ESP files
	in a format usable by the simulations the BZDev class library
	provides.
      <LI>HTML image maps (the image above uses an image map
	created with <STRONG>epts</STRONG>).
      <LI>lists of path lengths or the  areas of closed paths.
    </UL>
    User-supplied templates can be used as well.  Coordinates of
    points can be in Java user-space units or in some other units,
    defined by setting a scale factor.  For distances, the values are
    scaled to meters.  When running the points and paths can be
    overlayed on a pre-existing image. In this case, the appropriate
    scaling can be determined by measuring a distance in Java
    user-space units and providing the corresponding distance in the
    application's units. The source code is available
    on <A HREF="https://github.com/BillZaumen/epts">GitHub</A>.
  <LI><STRONG>geth</STRONG>. This program is a simple utility that
    issues HTTP requests and prints the headers in a response. It can
    also print the content if the content is text.  The headers include
    all those in an exchange, including HTTP redirects. Headers can be
    set in requests as well, which is useful for analyzing web sites that
    base their responses on the browser or operating system in use. The
    source code is available on
    <A HREF="https://github.com/BillZaumen/geth">GitHub</A>.

  <LI><STRONG>webnail</STRONG>. This program can scale images (one or
    more) to fit into a specified bounding box. For just scaling
    images, the output can be in a variety of formats: single images,
    a directory, or a zip file. In addition, <STRONG>webnail</STRONG>
    can create a web site in  one of four format:
    <UL>
      <LI> A web-site directory. The directory will contain an HTML file
	and several subdirectories containing images and two ECMAScript
	files, both used for navigation and to run slideshows.
      <LI> A web-site ZIP file. The ZIP file created contains the same
	files and directory structure used in the first option
	(a web-site directory).
      <LI> A directory for a web archive. This option creates a web-archive
	directory containing images, ECMAScript files for controlling a
	slideshow, and a servlet for cases in which multiple systems should
	show the same images at the same time.
      <LI> A web-archive (WAR) file. This option creates a web-archive
	file (WAR file) containing images, ECMAScript files for
	controlling a slideshow, and a servlet for cases in which
	multiple systems should show the same images at the same time.
    </UL>
    <STRONG>Webnail</STRONG> allows the user to set various options for
    this case (for example, titles) and to reorder images and add a
    title to each that can be displayed when a mouse hovers over an image.
    Images can be added in various ways including simply dragging them from
    a folder. The source code is available on
    <A HREF="https://github.com/BillZaumen/webnail">GitHub</A>.
</UL>
The source code for these programs and libraries can be used as
extended coding examples. For use on Debian systems, the packages
containing these programs should be in the same repository as the
package <CODE>libbzdev-java</CODE>.

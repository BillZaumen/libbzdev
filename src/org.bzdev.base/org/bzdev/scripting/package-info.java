/**
 * Package to support scripting, with or without security.
 * <P>
 * There are a number of applications whose configuration cannot be
 * handled very well by a GUI, or where the level of usage and number
 * of users does not justify the effort needed in developing a GUI.
 * An obvious alternative is to use scripts to configure the application,
 * but there are security issues if users exchange scripts. This package
 * provides classes to simplify adding scripting to an application and
 * managing security.
 * <P>
 * <B>Please see
 * <A href="doc-files/description.html">the package description</A> for
 * a full description of this package.</B>

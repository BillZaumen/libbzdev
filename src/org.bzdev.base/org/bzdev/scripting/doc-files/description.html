<H1>The org.bzdev.scripting package</H1>

This package provides several classes shown in the following UML
diagram:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="scripting.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<UL>
  <LI>ScriptingContext provides protected methods for specifying a script
    engine,the default bindings to use (the scope is the one specified
    the <CODE>javax.script.ScriptContext</CODE> field
    <CODE>ENGINE_SCOPE</CODE>),the script language (which should be
    the official name such as ECMAScript for JavaScript).  Subclasses
    should implement these methods unless configured to use a parent
    ScriptingContext, in which case the parent&apos;s script and bindings
    are used.
    A ScriptingContext can have a parent scripting context.  The parent
    will provide the actual scripting operations, but may have a different
    trust level (see below).
  <LI>{@link Scripting} is a class containing
    only static methods and allows one to look up information about
    the scripting languages that a Java implementation supports (this
    may depend on the class path or module path).
</UL>
<P>
The class ScriptingContext itself does not directly enable
scripting: several methods need to be implemented to enable it.
This can be done by the class DefaultScriptingContext, which allows one
to create a ScriptingContext given just the scripting-language
name.  A second class, ExtendedScriptingContext, provides methods
for creating Java arrays and for calling Java constructors (a
bug/feature in at least one older scripting-language implementation
prevented a script from creating an instance of a class that is a
subclass of ScriptingContext, so a work-around was needed for this
case).

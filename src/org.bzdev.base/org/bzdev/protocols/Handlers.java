/**
 * Configuration class for protocol handlers.  This class enables
 * various protocol handlers by setting or modifying a system property
 * for handlers defined in subpackages of the current package.  Only
 * the subpackages actually intended for use should be included in an
 * application.  Protocol Properties are set by setting system properties
 * whose names start with "org.bzdev.protocols." followed by the name
 * of the protocol or scheme, followed by a period and then the name of the
 * property.
 * When protocol handlers are enabled by calling <code>Handlers.enable()</code>,
 * system properties starting with "<code>org.bzdev.protocols.</code>" are
 * read and stored under a key consisting of the remainder of the
 * system-property key. Thus, a system property named
 * <code>org.bzdev.protocols.resource.path</code> is used to set the
 * <em>path</em> property for the <em>resource</em> protocol. A call
 * to Handlers.get("resource.path") will return this property.
 * <P>
 * The supported schemes are
 * <ul>
 *  <li> resource. This scheme looks up resources based on a class
 *       path whose entries are separated by the path-separator character
 *       ('|' on Unix/Linux systems) and that is stored in
 *       a system property named org.bzdev.protocols.resource.path. If
 *       this system property is not provided, the system class loader
 *       will be used as a default. The path entry $classpath
 *       indicates that the system class loader will be used to look
 *       for the resource, and may be included as a component in the
 *       class path. It should be the first entry when it is desirable
 *       to prevent other classes from overriding a resource that the
 *       system class loader would otherwise provide. The class path's
 *       components are directories, jar files, zip files, or URLs
 *       ("http", "https", "ftp", "file", or "jar") and must point to
 *       a directory or similar object, not a specific file. As a
 *       reminder, a "jar" URL starts with "jar", followed by a URL for
 *       the jar or zip file, followed by "!/", and then a path. The
 *       entries will be searched in the order they appear (left to right).
 *       The "resource" URL itself consists of the protocol specification,
 *       "resource:", followed by a path naming the resource. This path
 *       is added to the end of the URL for each entry until a resource can
 *       be found or the entry list is exhausted.
 *  <li> sresource. This scheme looks up resources using the
 *       system class loader.
 * </ul>
 * For the <code>sresource</code> scheme, the handler simply uses
 * the method {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader()} to
 * find the system class loader and then uses the method
 * {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getResource(String)} to obtain a URL
 * that will allow access to the resource. This URL is used instead of
 * the 'sresource' URL, so security is provided by the standard Java
 * mechanisms.  For the <code>resource</code> scheme, additional
 * permissions have to be granted.  The locations for the resource
 * (typically JAR files, ZIP files, or directories, but possibly resources
 * accessible over a network connection) are provided by the system
 * property described above, and cannot be changed once
 * {@link Handlers#enable()} is called.  Furthermore, unless a specific
 * permission is granted, {@link Handlers#enable()} will fail if called
 * after a security manager is installed. In addition, the path portion
 * of the URL (the part after "resource:"), is checked so that
 * <ul>
 *  <li> the path does not contain any illegal characters: ones not
 *       allowed by RFC 3986.  The character '\' specifically is not
 *       allowed as a literal character in the URL.
 *  <li> ".." entries in the path will not result in access to an
 *       ancestor of an entry in the list of resource locations.
 * </ul>
 * After Java 8, a module system was added to Java and this places
 * some constraints on the visibility of resources. Generally, a module
 * must declare a package to be "open" for its resources to be accessible.
 * The unnamed module (i.e., the code accessed via a classpath) is
 * open. For named modules, the module-info.java file must explicitly
 * indicate that a package is open (a Java command-line option can also
 * be used, but there is no guarantee that this option will not be
 * eliminated in future releases.)  For the "resource" protocol, however,
 * the files or directories explicitly listed by the
 * <CODE>org.bzdev.protocols.resource.path</CODE> property are accessed
 * through the file system, bypassing any constraints imposed by the
 * Java module system with one exception: the path component
 * <CODE>$classpath</CODE> will have its resources searched using the
 * system class loader.

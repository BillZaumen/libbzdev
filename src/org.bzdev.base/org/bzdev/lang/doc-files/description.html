<H2><A ID="callable"></A>The Callable interface</H2>

Starting with the initial version of Java (1.0), Java has provided an
interface named <CODE>Runnable</CODE> with a single method named
<CODE>run()</CODE>. This is used to provide the code that a thread will
run.  The earliest version of the BZDev class library (not publicly
released) included a corresponding interface named <CODE>Callable</CODE>
with a zero argument method named <CODE>call()</CODE>. The interface
<CODE>Callable</CODE> is a synonym for <CODE>Runnable</CODE> in terms
of functionality, but was added for two reasons:
<UL>
  <LI>to document that one was providing a method to be called, not the
    code that a thread to run.
  <LI>so that one could discriminate between code that should be run in
    a thread from code that could be called. In particular, the
    org.bzdev.devqsim package allows both to be scheduled and needed to
    be able to tell the difference between the two cases at compile time.
    Similarly, the org.bzdev.scripting package contains a class that uses
    the <CODE>Callable</CODE> interface.
</UL>
Subsequently, with the introduction of streams and lambda expressions,
the package java.util.concurrent also defined an interface named
<CODE>Callable</CODE>. While one would prefer that the names were
different, the chances of a name conflict are small: the
discrete-event simulation classes runs only one thread at a time, and it
is not advisable to use multithreading with scripting unless one can
ensure that only a single thread runs at any particular time.
<P>
The <CODE>Callable</CODE> interface provided by this class library does not
take any arguments and does not return a value. There are, however, several
related interfaces:
<UL>
  <LI><CODE>CallableArgs&lt;Args&gt;</CODE>. This interface provides a method
    named <CODE>call</CODE> that does not return a value and that takes any
    number of arguments of type <CODE>Args</CODE>.
  <LI>CallableArgsReturns&lt;T,Args&gt;. This interface provides a method
    named <CODE>call</CODE> that returns a value of type T and that takes any
    number of arguments of type <CODE>Args</CODE>.
  <LI>CallableReturns&lt;T&gt;. This interface provides a method
    named <CODE>call</CODE> that This interface provides a method
    named <CODE>call</CODE> that returns a value of type T and that does not
    take any arguments.
  <LI><CODE>ExceptionedCallable</CODE>. interface provided by this class
    library does not take any arguments and does not return a
    value. It may throw an exception (any subclass of java.lang.Exception).
  <LI><CODE>ExceptionedCallableArgs&lt;Args&gt;</CODE>. This interface
    provides a method named <CODE>call</CODE> that does not return a
    value and that takes any number of arguments of

    java.lang.Exception).
  <LI>ExceptionedCallableArgsReturns&lt;T,Args&gt;. This interface
    provides a method named <CODE>call</CODE> that returns a value of
    type T and that takes any number of arguments of
    type <CODE>Args</CODE>. It may throw an exception (any subclass
    of java.lang.Exception).
  <LI>ExceptionedCallableReturns&lt;T&gt;. This interface provides a
    method named <CODE>call</CODE> that returns a value of type T and
    that does not take any arguments. It may throw an exception (any
    subclass of java.lang.Exception).

<H2><A ID="lib"></A>Library loading</H2>
<p>
The class ResourceLibLoader supports looking up and loading a resource
containing a shared library. A naming convention is used to allow the
correct resource to be obtained for a given version of the operating
system and a given machine architecture.
<H2><A ID="dmethods"></A>Dynamic Methods</H2>
<p>
Normally Java looks up an object&apos;s method at run time but bases the
lookup on the method&apos;s signature (specifically the types of the
method&apos;s arguments), which is determined at compile time. While
this restriction is desirable for performance reasons, it is
sometimes easier to develop software if dynamic methods are
supported, in which the argument types are determined at run time.
The org.bzdev.lang package supports dynamic methods by using
annotations (staring with release 6 of the JDK, annotations are
supported by the Java compiler). The mechanism is efficient, but
with two restrictions: dynamic methods cannot be static methods and
the use of generic types is not supported. The primary reason for
not allowing generic types is that type-erasure is not compatible
with the dispatch methods provided by "helper" classes.
<P>
Dynamic methods are supported by 6 annotation types (only 3 or 4 are needed
for the simplest cases).  The necessary types are
<ul>
<li> DynamicMethod. This annotation tags a method specified in a class
     or an interface as a dynamic method, proving the most general type
     for the methods (which can have return values and throw exceptions as
     desired). It takes the class name of a "helper" class as its argument
     (the helper class will be generated automatically).  A dynamic method
     may not be a static method.
<li> DMethodImpl. This annotation tags a method as being one that implements
     a dynamic method for specific argument types, and takes the name of
     the helper class used in the DynamicMethod annotation as an argument
     (the class name serves as a key to match dynamic method implementations
     with the corresponding dynamic method). These methods may be declared
     to be static.
<li> DMethodContext or DMethodContexts. Each class that implements a
     dynamic method needs a "local helper" class for that dynamic method.
     A DMethodContext annotates the class that implements a dynamic method
     and, using the dynamic method&apos;s helper class as a key, provides the
     corresponding local helper class.  If a class implements multiple
     dynamic methods, The DMethodContexts method should be used, which takes
     an array of DMethodContext annotations as its argument.  A class
     annotated with DMethodContext or DMethodContexts must be declared to
     be static if the class is an inner class.
</ul>
<p>
The two remaining annotations provide additional control:
<ul>
<li> DMethodOptions allows one to control the locking used by the
     helper class, to allow optimizations for single-threaded programs,
     to adjust cache sizes, and to enable tracing of method searches.
     The locking-mode values allow one to specify no locking, a mutex lock,
     a read-write lock, or a system default (normally a mutex but this can
     be changed at compile time).
<li> DMethodOrder is used when dynamic methods are dispatched based on
     multiple arguments.  It controls the search order for arguments and
     determines which arguments should use compile-time types rather than
     run-time types.
</ul>
<p>
The implementation of a dynamic method should call its helper&apos;s dispatch
method, returning a value of the return type is not void. The first argument
to <code>dispatch</code> must be <code>this</code>, followed by the arguments
declared in the method. Each class that implements a dynamic method has
a DMethodContext annotation, specifying a local helper, for that method, 
and must call the local helper&apos;s <code>register</code> method in a static 
initializer, calling <code>register</code> with no arguments.  If the
system class loader is set to org.bzdev.lang.DMClassLoader, the
<code>register</code> method will be called automatically. One can change
the system class loader to DMClassLoader by setting the following option
for the java command:
<pre><code>
 java -Djava.system.class.loader=org.bzdev.lang.DMClassLoader ...
</CODE></PRE>
<p>
For hints on how to use the compiler and what to include in JAR
files, see the documentation for <code>DynamicMethod</code>.
<p>
An example for the use of a dynamic method when the dynamic method is 
specified in a class is the following (note: when referring to a helper
in a different package, the fully qualified class name must be used):
<pre><code>
public class Foo {
     {@literal @}DynamicMethod("FooIncrHelper")
     public  Number incr(Number x) throws Exception {
        return FooIncrHelper.getHelper().dispatch(this, x);
     }
 }

{@literal @}DMethodContext(helper="FooIncrHelper", localHelper="BarIncrHelper")
public class Bar extends Foo {
    static {
        BarIncrHelper.register();
    }

    {@literal @}DMethodImpl("FooIncrHelper")
    public Number doIncr(Integer x) thows Exception {
        return Integer.valueOf(x + 1);
    }
}
</CODE></PRE>
The call to dispatch will throw a runtime exception named
{@link org.bzdev.lang.MethodNotPresentException MethodNotPresentException>}
if no method that matches the arguments is found. This exception can be
caught to implement the default behavior for the dispatch method and is
located in the org.bzdev.lang package.
 *<P>
If <code>incr</code> was declared in an interface, an implementation must
appear in the least specific class(es) that implement that interface.
For example:
<pre><code>
public interface Incrementer {
     {@literal @}DynamicMethod("FooIncrementerHelper")
     public Number incr(Number x) throws Exception;
}

{@literal @}DMethodContext(helper="FooIncrementerHelper",
                 localHelper="FooIncrHelper")
public class Foo implements Incrementer {
    static {
        FooIncrHelper.register();
    }
    public Number incr(Number x) {
        return FooIncrementerHelper.getHelper().dispatch(this, x);
    }
    {@literal @}DMethodImpl("IncrementerHelper")
    public Number doIncr(Integer x) thows Exception {
        return Integer.valueOf(x + 1);
    }
}

{@literal @}DMethodContext(helper="IncrementerHelper", localHelper="BarIncrHelper")
public class Bar extends Foo {
    static {
        BarIncrHelper.register();
    }
    {@literal @}DMethodImpl("IncrementerHelper")
    public Number doIncr(Bar x) thows Exception {
        return Integer.valueOf(x + 1);
    }
}
</CODE></PRE>

<H3>Background</H3>
<p> Several other approaches have been used to create similar
capabilities.
<p>
One approach that is used when dynamic methods are not supported
in a language is to use the visitor design pattern. The idea is to define 
two interfaces such as <code>Visitor</code> and <code>Visitable</code>
defined as follows:
<pre><code>
    interface Visitor {
      void visit(Foo obj);
      void visit(Bar obj);
    }
    interface Visitable {
        void accept(Visitor arg);
    }
</code></pre>
then <code>Foo</code> is defined as follows:
<pre><code>
    class Foo implements Visitable {
      void accept(Visitor arg) {
          arg.visit(this);
      }
    }

    class Bar extends Foo {
      void accept(Visitor arg) {
          arg.visit(this);
      }
    }

    class SomeVisitor implements Visitor {
       void visit(Foo obj) {
         ...
       }

       void visit(Bar obj) {
         ...
       }
    }
</code></pre>
For mimicking dynamic methods, the <code>accept</code> method is
written as given above: it merely calls the visit method with an
argument of <code>this</code>, whose type matches the type of the
class in which the <code>accept</code>method is defined.  The
<code>accept</code> method is defined in all subclasses as well
(subclasses of <code>Foo</code> in this example), so that the type
at run time is known in the call to <code>visit</code>.  When
<code>accept</code> is called on an object of type Foo, even if
referenced by a variable declared to be <code>Visitable</code>, the
<code>accept</code> method that is called is the one defined for
<code>Foo</code>. The <code>accept</code> method of
<code>Foo</code> then calls its argument&apos;s <code>visit</code>
method, passing it an argument of type <code>Foo</code>.
<p>
The downside to the use of this design pattern is that every time a
new class that implements <code>Visitable</code> is defined, one
must add a method to the <code>Visitor</code> interface and all
<code>Visitor</code> classes must then implement that new method,
even if there is really nothing for the method to do.  In addition,
as mentioned above, an accept method must be defined in all classes
that implement Visitable and their subclasses, which is tedious
when there are a number of subclasses.  In addition, the interface
and class definitions are typically in separate files.  Attempts to
mitigate these limitations have included the use of the Java
reflection API
<a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/paper/compsac98.pdf">
(Jens Palsberg and C. Barry Jay, "The Essence of the Visitor
Pattern")<a>; however, the run-time cost is substantial: what would
take 1.17 seconds using the visitor design pattern took 4 minutes,
59.93 seconds using the reflection API, an increase in running time
of about a factor of 300 for trivial methods.
<p>
An alternative approach, which generates byte codes at runtime and
loads those into the Java virtual machine, has also been proposed
<a href="http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2005_12/article3/">
(R&eacute;mi Fora, Etienne Duris, and Gilles Roussel,
"Reflection-based implementation of Java extensions: the
double-dispatch use-case")</a>.  This latter approach is far more
efficient (and comparable to the approach described below) but may
fail when a sandbox security model is in use due to restrictions on
generating new classes at run time (e.g., in applets and assuming no
changes to the Java language). Security managers, however, have been
removed from recent versions of Java.
<p>
The <code>DynamicMethod</code> annotation and some related
annotations provides a design pattern that addresses some of these
issues by allowing method look-up to be performed more efficiently
at run time, with all the application code created at compile time
so that there are no issues with security managers.  A simple
design pattern must be followed. One declares a dynamic method
using a <code>DynamicMethod</code> annotation: for example,
<pre><code>
 public class Foo {
     {@literal @}DynamicMethod("FooIncrHelper")
     public  Number incr(Number x) throws Exception {
        return FooIncrHelper.dispatch(this, x);
     }
 }
</code></pre>
This annotation declares that a generated class named FooIncrHelper
will provide a method called dispatch that implements a dynamic
method. The arguments for dispatch in the helper class are
<code>this</code> to indicate the current instance, followed by the
arguments for the method <code>incr</code>.  If the DynamicMethod
annotation appeared in an interface declaration, then a class
implementing the method and calling the helper&apos;s dispatch method
must appear in the first subclass of Object implementing the
interface.
<p>
A subclass of Foo that implements the dynamic method <code>incr</code> will
then use a DMethodImpl annotation to tag a method implementing the dynamic
method for particular argument types (the dynamic method implementing incr
will have a different name). The subclass itself will be annotated with a
DMethodContext annotation, which provides the name of a subclass-specific
helper class (the localHelper attribute) and associates it with the helper 
for the dynamic method incr.  For example,
<pre><code>
{@literal @}DMethodContext(helper="FooIncrHelper", localHelper="BarIncrHelper")
public class Bar extends Foo {
    static {
       BarIncrHelper.register();
    }
    {@literal @}DMethodImpl("FooIncrHelper")
    public Number doIncr(Integer x) throws Exception {
        return Integer.valueOf(x + 1);
    }
}
</code></pre>
The static method <CODE>register()</CODE> provided by the local-helper
class must be called when a class is initialized and when the annotation
<CODE>{@literal @}DMethodContext</CODE> is used. With earlier versions
of Java, a class loader provided by the org.bzdev.lang package could
call this method so that an explicit call would not be needed,but
unfortunately that class loader is not work when Java modules are
used.
<P>
If class Foo also provided a method annotated with 
<code>{@literal @}DMethodImpl("FooIncrHelper")</code>, Foo itself would have to
have a DMethodContext annotation with its helper attribute set to
<code>FooIncrHelper</code> and its localHelper attribute set to some
other class name.  When multiple {@literal @}DMethodContext annotations are
needed for a class, the annotation {@literal @}DMethodContexts should be
used - {@literal @}DMethodContexts has a single 'value' defined - an
array of {@literal @}DMethodContext. The design decision to annotate the
class with the local helper data rather than the individual method was
due in part for supporting the class loader
{@link org.bzdev.lang.DMClassLoader DMClassLoader}, which removes the
need for the static initializers that call register() methods of
the local helper classes.
<P>
The look-up can be based on more than one
argument, and the default behavior is to do nothing, which
eliminates the coding required when using the visitor design
pattern when a change to the <code>Visitor</code> interface is
made. The order in which argument types are searched can be controlled
with a DMethodOrder annotation, applied to method definition or
declaration annotated by the DynamicMethod annotation.
In addition, One may use a <code>throws</code> clause in the method
definitions and declarations.
<p>
For the single argument case, the overhead over a trivial implementation
(a couple of method calls, and an <code>if</code> statement using the
<code>instanceof</code> operator) is roughly a factor of 15, which can
be reduced to a factor of 10 by setting an option to turn off locking
for cases in which objects using a specific class are accessed by only
one thread at a time. This assumes the method called performs a trivial
operation - the overhead will not be noticeable if the method called 
does anything substantial.  The implementation uses "helper"
classes to dispatch method calls at run-time.  These classes are
automatically generated by the java compiler via an annotation processor.
For the two-argument case, the overhead is approximately factor of 34
with locking and 29 without locking (in both cases, the running time is
higher than in the single-argument case).
<p>
The equivalent of the visitor design pattern example above can be
implemented using dynamic methods.  For example:
<pre><code>
    interface Visitor {
        {@literal @}DynamicMethod("VisitorHelper")
        void visit(Object arg);
    }

    {@literal @}DMethodContext(helper = "VistorHelper",
                    localHelper = "SomeVisitorHelper")
    class SomeVisitor implements Visitor {
        static {
          SomeVisitorHelper.register();
        }
        void visit(Object arg) {
          VisitorHelper.getHelper().dispatch(this, arg);
        }

        {@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")
        void doVisit1(Foo arg) {
            ...
        }

        {@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")
        void doVisit2(Bar arg) {
            ...
        }
    }
</code></pre>
The <code>Visitable</code> interface is not needed, and explicit
methods can be added only for those argument classes (<code>Foo</code>
and <code>Bar</code> in this example) for which some action is needed.
The <code>Visitor</code> interface does not have to be modified, and
the <code>visit</code> method is not defined in subclasses of 
<code>SomeVisitor</code>. The method <code>doVisit(Foo)</code>
does not have to be defined in subclasses of <code>SomeVisitor</code>
unless it has to be coded differently in the subclass.
If a default action is needed, one can add a declaration such as
<pre><code>
        {@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")
        void doVisit(Object arg) {
            return;		// do nothing.
        }
</code></pre>
that will match any object passed as an argument.  Alternatively, one
may change the implementation of the <code>visit</code> method to
catch an exception that indicates that the dispatch mechanism could
not find a method to invoke:
<pre><code>
        void visit(Object arg) {
          try {
              VisitorHelper.getHelper().dispatch(this, arg);
          } catch (MethodNotPresentException e) {
          }
        }
</code></pre>
It is better in this case to define the <code>doVisit</code> method
with an argument of type <code>Object</code>, as one of the
<code>doVisit</code> methods may call a different dynamic method
that throws <code>MethodNotPresentException</code> due to a
programming error, in which case the partial execution of some
methods may put the application into an illegal state.
<p>
 The example above
assumes the use of a dynamic-method-aware class loader such as
{@link org.bzdev.lang.DMClassLoader org.bzdev.lang.DMClassLoader}. If
such a class loader is not used, then a static initializer has to be
added to the SomeVisitor class:
<pre><code>
    {@literal @}DMethodContext(helper = "VistorHelper",
                    localHelper = "SomeVisitorHelper")
    class SomeVisitor implements Visitor {
        static {
             SomeVisitorHelper.register();
        }
        ...
    }
</code></pre>
The call to the register() simply forces the SomeVisitorHelper class
to be initialized: during initialization, SomeVisitorHelper will
register itself with VisitorHelper to create tables that allow the
correct method to be looked up at run time.  The general rule is that
whenever a class is annotated with a {@literal @}DMethodContext or
{@literal @}DMethodContexts annotation, for each localHelper attribute
provided, there must be call to each helper&apos;s static method register()
in the class&apos; initializer.
<p>
In the example above, if all classes for which <code>visit</code>
can be called are subclasses of <code>SomeVisitor</code>, then
the interface definition is not needed and the code can be written
as follows:
<pre><code>
    {@literal @}DMethodContext(helper = "VistorHelper",
                    localHelper = "SomeVisitorHelper")
    class SomeVisitor {

        {@literal @}DynamicMethod("VisitorHelper")
        void visit(Object arg) {
          VisitorHelper.getHelper().dispatch(this, arg);
        }

        {@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")
        void doVisit(Foo arg) {
            ...
        }

        {@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")
        void doVisit(Bar arg) {
            ...
        }
    }
</code></pre>
Subclasses can implement <code>doVisit</code> methods, annotated
with <code>{@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")</code>, and
subclasses that implement this method must of course have a
<code>{@literal @}DMethodContext</code> annotation for the subclass with
a unique <code>localHelper</code> class name.  For a similar example
where a register() is called explicitly, one might define the
interface  (the complete file is shown)
<pre><code>
package dmtest;
import org.bzdev.lang.annotations.*;

public interface Visitor {
    {@literal @}DynamicMethod("VisitorHelper")
    void visit(Object arg);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
package dmtest.a;
import org.bzdev.lang.annotations.*;

{@literal @}DMethodContext(helper="VisitorHelper", localHelper="SomeVisitorHelper")
public class SomeVisitor implements Visitor {

    static {
        SomeVisitorHelper.register();
    }

    public void visit(Object arg) {
        VisitorHelper.getHelper().dispatch(this, arg);
    }

    {@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")
    void doVisit1(Double arg) {
        System.out.println("double = " + arg.toString());
    }

    {@literal @}DMethodImpl("VisitorHelper")
    void doVisit2(Integer arg) {
        System.out.println("integer = " + arg.toString());
    }

    public static void main(String argv[]) {
        Object obj1 = Double.valueOf(10.0);
        Object obj2 = Integer.valueOf(20);

        SomeVisitor sv = new SomeVisitor();

        sv.visit(obj1);
        sv.visit(obj2);
    }
}
</code></pre>
The output when the program is run is
<pre><code>
double = 10.0
integer = 20
</code></pre>
By contrast,  the following program will fail at compile time:
<pre><code>
package dmtest.a;
import org.bzdev.lang.annotations.*;

public class SomeVisitor2 {
    public void visit(Double arg) {
        System.out.println("double = " + arg.toString());
    }
    public void visit(Integer arg) {
        System.out.println("integer = " + arg.toString());
    }

    public static void main(String argv[]) {
        Object obj1 = Double.valueOf(10.0);
        Object obj2 = Integer.valueOf(20);

        SomeVisitor sv = new SomeVisitor();

        sv.visit(obj1);
        sv.visit(obj2);
    }
}
</code></pre>
Without dynamic methods, one would have to add a method such as
<pre><code>
    public void visit(Object arg) {
        if (arg instanceof Double) visit((Double) arg);
        else if (arg instanceof Integer) visit((Integer) arg);
    }
</code></pre>
which is error prone due to the need to make a change in multiple
places.

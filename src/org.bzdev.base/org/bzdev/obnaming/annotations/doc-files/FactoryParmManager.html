<H2>FactoryParmManager Description</H2>
<P>
The <CODE>FactoryParmManager</CODE> annotation may be applied to the
class definition for a subclass of NamedObjectFactory, and will be
ignored if applied to other classes.  If the subclass of
NamedObjectFactory is a generic class, the corresponding ParmManager
will also be a generic class with the same type parameters. The class
name of the ParmManager is specified by this
annotation's <CODE>value</CODE> element.
<P>
Additional elements can be provided for CompoundParmType in order
to specify resource bundles used for tips, labels, and parameter
documentation for the class being annotated. The resource bundles
are defined by property files that use annotation <CODE>value</CODE>
elements as keys. Annotations that provide such keys are
<A HREF="../PrimitiveParm.html">PrimitiveParm</A>,
<A HREF="../KeyedPrimitiveParm.html">KeyedPrimitiveParm</A>,
<A HREF="../CompoundParm.html">CompoundParm</A>, and
<A HREF="../KeyedCompoundParm.html">KeyedCompoundParm</A>.
<P>
For a string associated with a key in a label or tip resource
bundle to contain HTML constructs, the string must start with
<CODE>&lt;html&gt;</CODE> and end with <CODE>&lt;/html&gt;</CODE>.
For the HTML case when the <CODE>lsnof</CODE> program is used,
each <CODE>&lt;br&gt;</CODE> element will be replaced
with a space for these two resource bundles, and
the <CODE>&lt;/html&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;/html&gt;</CODE>
elements will be removed from the start and end of the  string
respectively.  Strings associated with parameter-documentation
resource bundles are assumed to be HTML fragments with one
additional element. These can be
inserted as-is into HTML documents and must be
formatted so that they can fit between a <CODE>&lt;DIV&gt;</CODE>
element and a matching <CODE>&lt;/DIV&gt;</CODE>. The additional
element is named JDOC and its contents use the same convention
as the Javadoc @link directive. The class name and optional
method or field will be turned into a link to the corresponding API
documentation.
<P>
In some cases, the parameter name consists of those provided by
multiple annotations, with a delimiter ("." by default) separating
each component. It is worth noting that the simulation and animation
classes in the BZDev class library, when used with a scripting
environment, assume that the delimiter will be ".".
<P>
The ParmManager class that is generated will have the same type
parameters as the factory it annotates. These must be replicated
literally when an instance is defined. For example,
* <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
    @FactoryParmManager(value="AbstractFooFactoryPM")
    public abstract class AbstractFooFactory&lt;OBJ extends Foo&gt; {
       ...
       AbstractFooFactory&lt;OBJ&gt; pm;
       protected AbstractFooFactory(Animation2D a2d) {
          pm = new AbstractFooFactoryPM&lt;OBJ&gt;(this);
          initParms(pm, AbstractFooFactory.class);
       }
    }
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
If this is not done, type-erasure errors will occur at compile time.
<P>
In actual use, one will also specify various resource bundles. These
are used to internationalized documentation.  The resource bundles
specify
<UL>
 <LI> <B>labels</B>. A label is a name that might be displayed by a
      GUI (Graphical User Interface).
 <LI> <B>tips</B>. A tip is a short description suitable for a tool
      tip - text that will appear when a mouse 'hoovers' over a
      control.
 <LI> <B>documentation</B>. Documentation consists of extended HTML
      text that can be used for a detailed description.
</UL>
Each resource bundle defines a series of properties whose keys are the
factory's parameter names. With resource bundles, the previous example
becomes
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
    @FactoryParmManager(value="AbstractFooFactoryPM",
                   labelResourceBundle="*.lpack.FooFactoryLabels",
                   tipResourceBundle="*.lpack.FooFactoryTips",
                   DocumenationResourceBundle="*.lpack.FooFactoryDocs")
    public abstract class AbstractFooFactory&lt;OBJ extends Foo&gt; {
       ...
       AbstractFooFactoryPM&lt;OBJ&gt; pm;
       protected AbstractFooFactory(Animation2D a2d) {
          pm = new AbstractFooFactoryPM&lt;OBJ&gt;(this);
          initParms(pm, AbstractFooFactory.class);
       }
    }
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The wildcards expands to the current package.  When wildcards are
used the properties must be placed in a subpackage whose first
component is "lpack". With java modules, this package must be an
open package: otherwise the resource will not be visible where it
is needed. If the factory class definition contains multiple type
parameters, those type parameters must be used for the parameter
manager in the same order, and the last one in the list must refer
to the type of the named object being created.
<P>
A FactoryParmManager declaration will typically be used for
abstract factories.  When the type of the object such a factory
initializes is not an abstract class, there should be a corresponding
factory to actually create the object. In most (but not all) cases the
code for these additional factories is similar.  For the typical case,
one can add an element, <CODE>stdFactory</CODE>, to the FactoryParmManager
annotation so that this factory will be automatically generated. For
example,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
    @FactoryParmManager(value="AbstractFooFactoryPM",
                   labelResourceBundle="*.lpack.FooFactoryLabels",
                   tipResourceBundle="*.lpack.FooFactoryTips",
                   DocumenationResourceBundle="*.lpack.FooFactoryDocs",
                   stdFactory="FooFactory",
                   namerVariable="a2d",
                   namerDocumentation="the animation")
    public abstract class AbstractFooFactory&lt;OBJ extends Foo&gt; {
       ...
       AbstractFooFactory&lt;OBJ&gt; pm;
       protected AbstractFooFactory(Animation2D a2d) {
          pm = new AbstractFooFactoryPM&lt;OBJ&gt;(this);
          initParms(pm, AbstractFooFactory.class);
       }
    }
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
In this example, the type of factory that creates a 'Foo' object is
FooFactory, its single-argument constructor has an argument named "sim",
and the Javadoc comment for "sim" is "the simulation".  The
namerVariable and namerDocumentation elements are optional, but should
generally be provided to make the Javadoc API documentation clearer.
When the <CODE>stdFactory</CODE> element is included, the type of the
named object being created must be provided as the last type parameter
listed.
</P>
In some unusual cases, one may want to use a FactoryParmManager
annotation when no ParmManager is needed (e.g., when creating
a subclass that removes a factory parameter defined by a superclass.
In this case, the value element can be set to an empty string:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
    @FactoryParmManager(value="",
                   stdFactory="Foo1Factory",
                   namerVariable="a2d",
                   namerDocumentation="the animation")
    public abstract class AbstractFoo1Factory&lt;OBJ extends Foo1&gt;
    extends AbstractFooFactory<Obj>
    {
       protected AbstractFoo1Factory(Animation2D a2d) {
          super(a2d);
          removeParm("foobar");
       }
    }
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Recommended options for the java compiler (we assume the
command-line syntax used in Sun Microsystem's implementation)
for non-modular jar files are
<pre><code>
 javac -d CLASSES -s TMPSRC \
        -classpath /usr/share/java/libbzdev.jar:CLASSES \
        FILES...
</code></pre>
where <code>CLASSES</code> is the name of a directory containing the
class files (with subdirectories matching the package
hierarchy), <code>TMPSRC</code> is a directory for files created by
the annotation processor, and <code>FILES...</code> is a list of source
files (with directories matching the package hierarchy).
Without <code>CLASSES</code> in the class path, you may get a warning
about implicitly compiled files. Without the '-s' flag, automatically
generated java files will appear in the CLASSES directory.

One should also list the fully qualified class names of each
non-abstract factory provided in a JAR file, one per line, in the file
<blockquote>
META-INF/services/org.bzdev.obnaming.NamedObjectFactory
</blockquote>
that will appear in the same JAR file (this uses the same
conventions as those used by Java's service-provider interface).
In particular, the program lsnof uses the information contained in
this file. When creating javadoc files (for the non-modular case)
one can use the following commands
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
    javadoc -d TARGET -sourcepath .:TMPSRC \
       -classpath CLASSES \
       FILES...
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where TARGET is the directory that will contain the API documentation
generated by javadoc and FILES are the files to document, and should
include the source files in TMPSRC.
<P>
When modules are used, one will typically create a directory named
mods and a subdirectory mods/MODULE where MODULE is the name of the
module (e.g., com.foo.bar). One will also create a directory tmpsrc
and a corresponding subdirectory tmpsrc/MODULE.  A typical compiler
command, assuming the source code is in a directory src, is
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
   javac -d mods/MODULE -p /usr/share/bzdev -s tmpsrc/MODULE \
         --processor-module-path /usr/share/bzdev \
         src/MODULE/module-info.java src/MODULE/DIR/*.java
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where DIR is the directory corresponding to a package name
following the usual Java conventions (e.g., com/foo/bar for the
package com.foo.bar). Placing generated source files in
tmpsrc/MODULE and the source tree in src/MODULE will make it easy
to use javadoc to generate documentation: for javadoc the
options
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
   -d TARGET
   --module-path PATH
   --module-source-path src:tmpsrc
   --add-modules MODULES
   --module MODULE
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
and possibly
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
   --exclude PACKAGES
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
are useful, where
<UL>
  <LI> TARGET is the directory that will hold the API documentation
  <LI> PATH is a list of directories separate by the path separator
      (":" for Linux or Unix, ';' for Windows), with each containing
      modular JAR files (a path entry may also be a modular JAR file)
  <LI> MODULES is a comma-separated list of modules that should be
       included in the documentation.
  <LI> PACKAGES is a colon-separated list of package names listing
       packages that should be excluded (fully qualified package
       names are necessary). The BZDev class library has a number
       of packages for which the last component of their names is
       "lpack". These packages contain Java "properties" files and
       are used for localization. As such, they should not be documented.
</UL>
The module-info file should contain a 'provides' clause (which is necessary
for the program <CODE>lsnof</CODE> to recognize factories):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
module ... {
     provides org.bzdev.obnaming.NamedObjectProcessor with
        FACTORY_LIST;
}
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where FACTORY_LIST is a comma-separated list of the factories in
the module that are not abstract classes.
One will typically want to use the program lsnof as well. For example
lsnof corresponding the javadoc options shown above are
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
   lsnof -d TARGET --module-path PATH CLASSNAME...
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where TARGET and PATH match the valued provided for the javadoc
command shown above. Multiple class names should be provided, one
for each factory.  lsnof allows wildcards in the class name, but in
any case, all the factories being documented should be listed
matching fully-qualified class names.
<P>
The API documentation describing factory parameters will be places
in the directory TARGET/factories-api and it is useful to include
this documentation the factory's full API documentation by using
an HTML IFRAME.  If the factory's fully qualified class name is
org.foo.pkg.Factory, then the SRC attribute for an IFRAME in this
factory's javadoc comments would be
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
 SRC="{@docRoot}/factories-api/org/foo/pkg/Factory.html"
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
If lsnof is used to generate documentation the FactoryParmManager
elements <CODE>labelResourceBundle</CODE> and <CODE>tipResourceBundle</CODE>
must be defined.  In many cases,<CODE>docResourceBundle</CODE> bundle
will be needed as well.

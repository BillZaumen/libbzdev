<H2>ObjectNamer Description</H2>

An object-namer class is paired with a corresponding named-object
class that is a common superclass of all named objects that can be
handled by a specific object namer.
<P>
A "helper class" providing the implementation is spliced into the
class hierarchy.  The class annotated with this annotation provides
the object namer, while the helper class will not be visible
outside of its package.  A similar annotation provides a helper for
the named-object class.  The object-namer class must extend the
helper class, which can be configured to extend another class.
<p>
As a simple example, to add an object-namer capability to a class
that must extend ScriptingContext and that uses TestObject as its
named-object class, one would use the following class definition:
<pre><code>
@ObjectNamer(helperClass = "NHelper",
             helperSuperclass = "org.bzdev.scripting.ScriptingContext",
             objectClass = "TestObject",
             objectHelperClass = "OHelper")
public class TestNamer extends NHelper implements ObjectNamerOps&lt;TestObject&gt; {
  ...
}
</code></pre>
where the named-object class TestObject uses the class OHelper as its
helper class.
<P>
For a more complex example, suppose the superclass uses type parameters
and has multiple constructors, some of which may throw exceptions:
<pre><code>
@ObjectNamer(helperClass = "NHelper",
             helperSuperclass = "NumberStore",
             helperSuperclassTypeParms = "&lt;Integer&gt;"
             helperSuperclassConstrTypes =
             {
               @ObjectNamer.ConstrTypes({"int"}),
               @ObjectNamer.ConstrTypes(
                   values = {"int", "float"},
                   exceptions = {"IllegalArgumentException"}),
             objectClass = "TestObject",
             objectHelperClass = "OHelper")
public class TestNamer extends NHelper implements ObjectNamerOps&lt;TestObject&gt; {
   ...
   public TestNamer(int initialCapacity) {
       super(initialCapacity);
       ...
   }
   public TestNamer(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
      throws IllegalArgumentException
   {
      super(initialCapacity, loadFactor);
      ...
   }
}
</code></pre>
The helper class' superclass will be NumberStore&lt;Integer&gt; and the
helper class will have two constructors, the first of which has
an argument that is an int, and the second of which has two arguments
(an int and a double).  The class TestNamer's constructor will have
to have constructors that call its superclass' constructors with
the arguments defined in the @ObjectNamer annotation.
Finally, ObjectNamerOps is provided so that javadocs will document
public methods for object namers.  Its use is not mandatory.
<P>
Recommended options for the java compiler (we assume the
command-line syntax used in Sun Microsystem's implementation)
for non-modular jar files are
<pre><code>
 javac -d CLASSES -s TMPSRC \
        -classpath /usr/lib/libbzdev/libbzdev.jar:CLASSES \
        FILES...
</code></pre>
where <code>CLASSES</code> is the name of a directory containing
the class files (with subdirectories matching the package
hierarchy), <code>TMPSRC</code> is a directory for files created by
the annotation processor, and <code>SRC</code> is a directory (or
search path) containing source files (again with subdirectories
matching the package hierarchy).  Without <code>CLASSES</code> in
the class path, you may get a warning about implicitly compiled
files. Without the '-s' flag, automatically generated java files
will appear in the CLASSES directory.
<p>
During compilation, the JAR file containing the org.bzdev.base
module must be accessible from the class path, as must the file
<blockquote>
META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor
</blockquote>
(the libbzdev.jar file contains both).  For separate compilation,
the class files corresponding to the helper files are needed.
<P>
When modules are used, one will typically create a directory named
mods and a subdirectory mods/MODULE where MODULE is the name of the
module (e.g., com.foo.bar). One will also create a directory tmpsrc
and a corresponding subdirectory tmpsrc/MODULE.  A typical compiler
command, assuming the source code is in a directory src, is
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
   javac -d mods/MODULE -p /usr/share/bzdev -s tmpsrc/MODULE \
         --processor-module-path /usr/share/bzdev \
         src/MODULE/module-info.java src/MODULE/DIR/*.java
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where DIR is the directory corresponding to a package name
following the usual Java conventions (e.g., com/foo/bar for the
package com.foo.bar). Placing generated source files in
tmpsrc/MODULE and the source tree in src/MODULE will make it easy
to use javadoc to generate documentation: for javadoc the
options
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
   -d TARGET
   --module-path PATH
   --module-source-path src:tmpsrc
   --add-modules MODULES
   --module MODULE
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
and possibly
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
   --exclude PACKAGES
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
are useful. For these options,
<UL>
  <LI> TARGET is the directory that will hold the API documentation
  <LI> PATH is a list of directories separate by the path separator
      (":" for Linux or Unix, ';' for Windows), with each containing
      modular JAR files.
  <LI> MODULES is a comma-separated list of modules that should be
       included in the documentation.
  <LI> PACKAGES is a colon-separated list of package names listing
       packages that should be excluded (Fully qualified package
       names are necessary). The BZDev class library has a number
       of packages for which the last component of their names is
       "lpack". These packages contain Java "properties" files and
       are used for localization. As such, they should not be documented.

/**
 * Package augmenting the java.net package.
 * <P>
 * This package provides a class that can quote strings for use in
 * HTML or javascript string. It also provides the ability to
 * encapsulate an existing URL (for example, to wrap some operations
 * in a doPrivileged block), and a class that can add additional
 * code bases to a system-provided URL class loader.

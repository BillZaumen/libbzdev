This package provides a simulation flavor that essentially
instantiates the {@link org.bzdev.drama.generic} package but with no extra
capabilities.  The class hierarchy is a minor extension of the class
hierarchy used in the generic simulation package, as the following UML
diagram shows (the classes in org.bzdev.drama.generic are shown in
blue):
<P style="text-align:center">
<img src="drama.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
The classes {@link DramaSimObject}
and {@link AbstractTaskObject} are
provided in case it is necessary to create simulations with new types
of objects that should not be subclasses of
{@link Actor}, {@link Group},
{@link Domain},
{@link DomainMember}, or
{@link Condition}.
<P>
Similarly {@link org.bzdev.obnaming.NamedObjectFactory named-object factories}
are subclasses of the corresponding factories defined in
org.bzdev.drama.generic.  These are shown in the following diagram:
<P style="text-align:center">
<img src="dfactories.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
All the named-object factories that are direct subclasses of the
factory classes in {@link org.bzdev.drama.generic} are abstract
classes. When the corresponding simulation object is not an abstract
class, there is also a factory that can create it.
<P>
The {@link org.bzdev.drama} package provides all the capabilities
provided by the {@link org.bzdev.devqsim} package. It's main addition
is the {@link org.bzdev.drama.Actor Actor} class, which provides for one
actor to send messages to another actor, with the delivery delayed by
some specified or computed time. The {@link org.bzdev.drama.Actor Actor}
class is supported by several other classes:
<UL>
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.drama.Condition Condition}. Conditions represent
    some global condition that can affect multiple actors. When the state
    of a condition changes, it can notify various domains and
    actors.
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.drama.Group Group}. A group is basically a
    distribution list with the capabilities of forwarding a message to
    actors that have joined the group or other groups that have joined
    the group.
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.drama.Domain Domain}. A domain is a collection
    of actors. It can add conditions, in which case the domain's actors
    will receive a notification when a condition changes.  A domain can
    also be configured as a communication domain, in which case an instance
    of {@link org.bzdev.drama.MsgForwardingInfo MsgForwardingInfo} will
    allow message-delivery times to be computed, and will allow messages
    to be filtered (transformed in some way or dropped as appropriate).
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.drama.MsgForwardingInfo MsgForwardingInfo}.
    This class will typically be subclassed to provide an appropriate delay
    or {@link org.bzdev.drama.common.MessageFilter message filter}. A
    message filter allows a message to be dropped or modified (e.g., to
    model bit errors that might occur during transmission of a message over
    some communication channel).
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.drama.DomainMember DomainMember}. A Domain member
    is an object that will join a domain on behalf of a series of actors.
    Its purpose is partly to simply configurations where a large number of
    actors will have the same domains, In some cases, its use improves
    performance.

As a coding example, a trivial simulation using this package might
create a subclass of {@link org.bzdev.drama.Actor} as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
import org.bzdev.devqsim.*;
import org.bzdev.drama.*;
import org.bzdev.lang.*;
import org.bzdev.lang.annotations.*;

{@literal @}DMethodContext(helper = "org.bzdev.drama.DoReceive"
                           localHelpter = "TestActorDoRecieve")
public class TestActor extends Actor {

    static {
      TestActorDoReceive.register();
    }

    public TestActor(DramaSimulation sim, String name, boolen intern) {
        super(sim, name, intern);
    }

    public void sendHello(Actor dest) {
        send("Hello", dest);
    }

    {@literal @}DMethodImpl("org.bzdev.drama.DoReceive")
    protected void doReceiveImpl(String msg, Actor source, boolean wasQueued) {
        System.out.format("at time %g, \"%s\" received by %s &amp; sent by %s\n",
                           getSimulation().currentTime(),
                           msg,
                           getName(),
                           source.getName());
    }
}
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This actor has a method that causes it to send a message to another
actor. Because a delay was not specified, the delay will be determined
by looking at the actor's communication domains.  Dynamic methods are
used to handle messages that have been received.
<P>
The example also creates a communication domain:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
import org.bzdev.drama.*:
public class TestDomain extends Domain {
    public TestDomain(DramaSimulation sim, String name, int priority) {
        super(sim, name, true, priority);
        configureAsCommunicationDOmain("network");
    }
}
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

A subclass of MsgForwardingInfo is also created. This determines
the delays when messages are routed though communication domains:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
import org.bzdev.drama.*:
public class TestMsgForwardingInfo extends MsgForwardingInfo {
    DramaSimulation sim;
    public TestMsgForwardingInfo(DramaSimulation sim, String name,
                                 boolean intern)
    {
       this.sim = sim;
    }
    protected long localDelay(Domain domain, Actor src,
                              Object msg, Actor dest)
    {
        return sim.getTicks(1.0);
    }
    // There are 8 similar localDelay methods
    ...

}
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Finally a main program creates a simulation, a domain, provides the
domain with a MsgForwardingInfo object so it can determine the appropriate
delays, creates two actors, and places them in the domain.
One actor's sendHello method is used to generate a message
and the simulation is then run.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
import org.bzdev.drama.*;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String argv[]) throws Exception {
        DramaSimulation sim = new DramaSimulation();
        Domain d = new Domain(sim, "d", true, 0);
        MsgForwardingInfo mfi = new TestMsgForwardingInfo(sim, "mfi", true);
        d.setMsgForwardingInfo(mfi);

        TestActor a1 = new TestActor(sim, "a1", true);
        TestActor a2 = new TestActor(sim, "a2", true);
        a1.joinDomain(d);
        a2.joinDomain(d);

        a1.sendHello(a2);

        sim.run();
    }
}

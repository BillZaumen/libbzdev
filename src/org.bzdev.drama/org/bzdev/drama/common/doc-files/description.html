<H2>The org.bzdev.drama.common package</H2>

Simulation <i>flavors</i> are simulation packages that are optimized
for particular application domains but that share an underlying
architecture.  Flavors are supported via the use of Java generics.
One flavor is provided by the org.bzdev.drama package, which more or
less mechanically reproduces the org.bzdev.drama.generic package
using similar names for objects and adding no additional functionality.
By contrast, a network-simulation package could define a class named
Node that extends GenericActor and a class named Link that extends
GenericGroup: the subclasses can be named to match particular classes
of simulations.
<P>
This package provides classes common to drama-based simulation flavors.
The core functionality for these simulation flavors are in the
org.bzdev.drama.generic package, whose public classes are all abstract
classes.  Classes that are likely to be needed by multiple simulation
flavors appear in the current package (org.bzdev.drama.common). The
classes, enumerations, and interfaces for org.bzdev.drama.common are
illustrated in the following diagram:

The class shown in blue is in the org.bzdev.drama.generic package.

The following interfaces and enumerations are defined in this package:
<ul>
 <li> ConditionObserver is an interface implemented by classes that
      wish to be notified of changes in conditions.
 <li> ConditionMode is an enumeration that describes the events that
      cause a condition-change notification to be sent.
 <li> DramaSimStateEventType is an enumeration providing the event types
      that the org.bzdev.drama.generic package adds to those defined by the
      org.bzdev.devqsim package's enumeration SimulationStateEvent.Type.
</ul>
The following classes are defined in this package:
<ul>
 <li> The class {@link CommDomainInfo} is
   used for finding domains of interest when domains are used to
   determine message delays and message filters.
 <li> The class {@link CommDomainType}
   defines a type of communication domain and allows these to be
   looked up by name. It is provided so that communication domain
   types can be compared using '==' instead of a string comparison.
 <li> The class {@link GroupInfo} is a common
   base class for simulation-specific classes that allow a group or
   actor to keep additional data about groups it has joined. That
   additional data is defined by a subclass.
 <li> The class {@link CondObserverImpl}
   provides an implementation for a condition observer.
 <li> The class {@link MessageRecipient}
   provides methods common to all message recipients (instances of
   Actor and Group in the org.bzdev.drama package). It is provided
   because the class SimulationAdapter needs it.
 <li> The class {@link SimulationAdapter}
   provides a default implementation for handling simulation state
   events.  The defaults do nothing (unless a constructor specifying a
   scripting context and script object are used) and one can override
   specific methods to obtain data about specific events.
 <li> The class {@link MessageFilter}
   provides the ability to manipulate messages while in transit,
   either dropping the message or modifying it in some way.
 <li> The
   class {@link CompoundMessageFilter}
   is a message filter that concatenates the effects of several
   message filters.

<H1>The org.bzdev.drama.generic package</H1>

This package provides the core functionality common to a number of
simulation <i>flavors</i> - simulation packages that are optimized
for particular application domains but that share an underlying
architecture.  Flavors are supported via the use of Java generics.
One flavor is provided by the org.bzdev.drama package, which more or
less mechanically reproduces the org.bzdev.drama.generic package
using similar names for objects and adding no additional functionality.
By contrast, a network-simulation package could define a class named
Node that extends GenericActor and a class named Link that extends
GenericGroup: the subclasses can be named to match particular classes
of simulations.
<p>
Because the use of generics is rather complex, a simplified
illustration of the design pattern that simulation flavors makes
use of should be helpful. Suppose we define two classes,
GenericFoo and GenericBar as follows:
<pre><code>
abstract class 
GenericFoo&lt;F extends GenericFoo&lt;F,B&gt;,B extends GenericBar&lt;F,B&gt;&gt;
{
  F getFoo() {returns null;}
  B getBar() {returns null;}
}
abstract class
GenericBar&lt;F extends GenericFoo&lt;F,B&gt;,B extends GenericBar&lt;F,B&gt;&gt;
{
  F getFoo() {returns null;}
  B getBar() {returns null;}
}
</CODE></PRE>
To make use of these classes, it is necessary to create subclasses
of the corresponding generic classes (both of them, not just one).
For example
<pre><code>
class Foo extends GenericFoo&lt;Foo,Bar&gt; {}
class Bar extends GenericFoo&lt;Foo,Bar&gt; {}
</CODE></PRE>
Then for Foo and Bar, even though the methods are actually
implemented by their superclasses, getFoo() will return a
value of type Foo and getBar() will return a value of type Bar.
Had we returned AbstractFoo and AbstractBar instead, type casts
or reimplementations of various methods would have been required,
making the code less reliable. The full declarations use the following
pattern:
<blockquote><pre>
   class OurClass&lt;S extends GenericSimulation&lt;S,A,C,D,DM,F,G&gt;,
                  A extends GenericActor&lt;S,A,C,D,DM,F,G&gt;,
                  C extends GenericCondition&lt;S,A,C,D,DM,F,G&gt;,
                  D extends GenericDomain&lt;S,A,C,D,DM,F,G&gt;,
                  DM extends GenericDomainMember&lt;S,A,C,D,DM,F,G&gt;,
                  F extends GenericFactory&lt;S,A,C,D,DM,F,G&gt;,
                  G extends GenericGroup&lt;S,A,C,D,DM,F,G&gt;&gt; ...
</pre></blockquote>
We will abbreviate the generic type declarations as
<blockquote><pre>
        S..G:&lt;&lt;std&gt;&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
in diagrams shown below.
<p>
The org.bzdev.devqsim package defines a Simulation class and a
SimObject class at the top of the class hierarchy, as illustrated
in the following UML class diagram:
<p style="ext-align: center">
<img src="genericdrama.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<p>
With a few exceptions
(e.g., {@link GenericSimulation}),
classes in this package inherit
from {@link GenericSimObject}, which is
necessary for any class that can be looked up by name from the
simulation&apos;s tables.  The
class {@link GenericFactory} provides a
standard interface to allow
the {@link GenericSimulation} class to
create objects it needs. While subclasses may extend it, in this
package it is used to create instances of domain members (generally a
subclass
of {@link GenericDomainMember},
created by the simulation for use by
the {@link GenericDomain} class and the
{@link GenericActor} class).
<P>
The subclasses of {@link GenericSimObject}
and {@link GenericTaskObject}
can be described as follows:
<ul>
  <li> {@link GenericActor} is the base
    class for objects that are the basic entities in the simulation -
    the objects that interact with each other.  They can be members of
    domains, can join groups, and can send messages, either directly
    to other actors or via groups.  Actors can also observe
    conditions.  When configured to do that, they will receive
    notifications when a condition changes.
  <li> {@link GenericGroup} is the base
    class for classes that distribute messages between actors,
    possibly relaying the messages through multiple groups.  A
    GenericGroup can be a member of a domain. Such a domain, if it is
    a communication domain, is used to determine the delay when
    messages are sent to that group without specifying the delay
    explicitly
  <li> {@link GenericDomain} is the base
    class for classes that represent sets of actors and can directly
    observe conditions. A domain can also provide actors or groups
    with propagation delays for the transmission or relaying of
    messages, and can provide a message filter to modify messages
    (e.g., to account for noise or to drop messages due to random
    errors in a communication medium). Domains that do this must be
    configured as communication domains by specifying a
    communication-domain type.  Domains can also observe conditions,
    with condition changes relayed to actors that are members of the
    domain and that are configured to receive condition-change updates
    from that domain.
  <li> {@link GenericCondition} the the
    base class for classes representing conditions - values that
    effect the actors in domains that "observe" a condition, and
    actors that directly observe conditions. A condition might, for
    example represent an error rate in communication channels that
    changes values at various times, or it could simply be
    software-related and do things such as controlling debugging via
    messages printed on a console.  Objects that might need to observe
    conditions without depending on a domain should implement the
    ConditionObserver interface and use the class
    ConditionObserverImpl to provide the implementation.  The
    documentation for ConditionObserverImpl contains the details.
  <li> {@link GenericMsgFrwdngInfo}
    is the base class for classes that allow delays and message
    filters to be looked up when a message is being sent.
 <li> Messages are simply subclasses of java.lang.Object and their
   interpretation is defined by each simulation.
</ul>
<p>
The {@link GenericTaskObject} class
provides some methods that create a thread or a default method to call
at some scheduled time.  For the thread, the implementation ensures
that only one instance of it runs at a time.  The subclasses of
{@link GenericTaskObject} are
{@link GenericDomain},
{@link GenericCondition},
{@link GenericActor},
{@link GenericGroup}
, and
{@link GenericMsgRecipient}
(which is merely a common superclass of
{@link GenericActor}
and {@link GenericGroup}). The relationship
between these classes in important for understanding the simulation.
<p>
Domains can assert an interest in conditions (the "has condition"
association in the UML diagram) and will be notified when a
condition changes.  These notifications are forwarded, eventually
reaching those actors that have joined a domain and asked to be
notified of condition changes.  Domains implement the CondObserver
interface, which allows a domain to be notified of condition
changes.  While domains are the only condition observers provided
in this package, it is easy to create other condition observers
(e.g., for use in statistics gathering).
<p>
Actors are the only entities in the simulations that can initiate sending
messages to message recipients, which can be either actors or
groups.  Groups forward the messages they receive to other groups
or a set if actors. The following state-transition diagram shows
the process for the case in which messages are sent directly,
specifying a delay to account for propagation time:
<P style="text-align:center">
<img src="message1.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
If a delay is not provided,  a domain is used to obtain the
delay. The domain can be provided explicitly.  In addition
to the delay, a message filter may also be provided by the
domain or a group. A message filter can modify messages or
drop them, and is provided to represent noisy communication
channels. This process
is illustrated by the following state-transition diagram:
<P style="text-align:center">
<img src="message2.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
The corresponding methods defined
by {@link GenericActor} are named "send"
but do not include a delay as an argument.  A message may pass through
multiple groups before reaching a destination.  When a "send" method
is called, the method will typically create an event of type
MessageSimulationEvent (used internally in this package)
and post that on the event queue.  The class structure is illustrated
in the following diagram:
<P style="text-align:center">
<IMG SRC="gevents.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
The classes shown in gray and light blue are classes from the
org.bzdev.devqsim package.  The classes in the org.bzdev.drama.generic
package are shown in black for public classes and blue for classes
visible only within the org.bzdev.drama.generic package and for classes
that are in the org.bzdev.drama.common package.
<P>
Finally, a number of abstract classes provide support for factories,
as shown in the following diagram:
<P style="text-align:center">
<IMG SRC="gdfactories.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
These can be subclassed to create various factories. See
{@link org.bzdev.devqsim.SimObjectFactory} and
{@link org.bzdev.obnaming.NamedObjectFactory}
for details.
<P>
Classes in this package will generally not have to be imported
by users of this class library: the classes needed are in the
org.bzdev.drama and org.bzdev.drama.common packages.

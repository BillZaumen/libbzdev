/**
 * Package for drawing graphs.
 * <P>
 * The graphs are rectangular areas in which various objects can
 * be drawn. In addition to device space and user space (defined
 * by Java), a {@link org.bzdev.graphs.Graph} will support a space called
 * graph coordinate space, which follows normal mathematical convention
 * where the X axis points right and the Y axis points up, and where units
 * are those that make sense to the application.
 * <P>
 * <B>Please see
 * <A HREF="doc-files/description.html">the package description"</A> for
 * additional information about this package.</B>

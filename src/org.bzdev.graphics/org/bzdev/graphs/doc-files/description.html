<H3>Introduction</H3>
The {@link Graph} class is the class that represents a graph. Java
graphics uses two coordinate systems, using the term "device space"
for an integer-valued coordinate system tied directly to how an output
device (including in-memory images) represent pixels, and the term
"user space" for a floating-point representation of coordinates in
which 72 units represents one inch, which is typical of computer
screens.  For instances of BufferedImage, the coordinates in both have
the same scale so that an x-coordinate of 1.0 in user space
corresponds to a value of 1 in device space.  For devices such as
printers, this is in general not true. The Graph class introduces a
third space named graph coordinate space, with units that fit the
application.  Graph coordinate space also uses mathematical
conventions for coordinate directions so that the positive y direction
points upwards rather than downwards on a display.
<P>
When an instance of {@link Graph} is initialized,
the constructor will determine the dimensions of the graph in
user-space coordinates.  One can then set x and y offsets to restrict
the drawing area from the borders and to leave room for labels.  A
method named setRanges then sets the ranges of values in graph
coordinate space that will be displayed in the box obtained by
reducing the height and width of the image by the amount specified by
the x and y offsets.
<P>
When drawing, one may whatever space is appropriate.  The
{@link Graph} method
{@link Graph#createGraphics} returns a
Graphics2D object for user space, but various drawing methods
automatically transform various shapes (including straight or curved
lines) from graph-coordinate space to user space.  For example, given
a Graph graph, a Graphics2D g2d = graph.createGraphics(), and a Path2D
path, with the path coordinates specified in graph coordinate space,
calling graph.draw(g2d, path) will transform the path to user space
and then draw it.  The method createGraphics returns a Graphics2D
configured for user space so that line thicknesses can be specified in
user space
<P>
Support classes (typically inner classes) allow axes to be drawn, font
parameters to be specified, and tick-marks on axes to be specified.
Several interfaces allow objects to define how they should be drawn, as
illustrated in the following UML diagram:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="graphs.png" class="imgBackground">
 *<P>
The interfaces whose names being with Graph.User specify objects
in user-space coordinates, and are intended for drawing icons that
should have a fixed size in user space.  The classes
{@link Graph.Drawable} and
{@link Graph.UserDrawable} apply to
objects that have a specified shape (i.e., an instance of Shape),
whereas the classes
{@link Graph.Graphic} and
{@link Graph.UserGraphic} are intended
for more complex operations.
<P>
In addition, the class {@link AxisBuilder}
and its subclasses can be used to simplify the construction of graph
axes for common cases. The class {@link Colors}
provides operations for creating colors based on various criteria: a
CSS specification, HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values, wavelength
for a monochromatic color, or a spectrum.  A method is also provided
to return the spectrum for blackbody radiation.

<H3><A NAME="linear"></A>Creating linear graphs</H3>

The following example shows how to use the {@link org.bzdev.graphs} package
to create graphs with linear axes. One will first import the
relevant packages:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.geom.*;
import java.io.*;
import org.bzdev.graphs.*;
import org.bzdev.gio.*;
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

To create a graph whose width is 800 points and whose height is 600 points
for an image format (e.g., PNG), use
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      Graph graph = new Graph(800, 600);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
To create a graph whose width is 800 points and whose height is 600 points
for an SVG (this requires that a service-provider package be installed)
or Postscript file (this example uses SVG), use
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("graph.svg");
      OutputStreamGraphics =
          OutputStreamGraphics.newInstance(800, 600, "svg");
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Then configure the graph so that the X values range from 0.0 to 500.0
and the Y values range from 0.0 to 400.0. We will also leave a margin
of 75 points to reserve space for axes labels, etc.:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      graph.setOffsets(75, 50, 75, 50);
      graph.setRanges(0.0, 500.0, 0.0, 400.0);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The left and bottom margins are larger to leave room for tick marks
and labels.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      AxisBuilder.Linear abx =
          new AxisBuilder.Linear(graph, 0.0, 0.0, 500.0, true, "X Axis");
      abx.setMaximumExponent(2);
      abx.setNumberOfSteps(10);
      abx.addTickSpec(0, 0, true, "%1.0f");
      abx.addTickSpec(2, 1, false, null);
      abx.addTickSpec(3, 5, null);

      AxisBuilder.Linear aby =
          new AxisBuilder.Linear(graph, 0.0, 0.0, 400.0, false, "Y Axis");
      aby.setMaximumExponent(2);
      aby.setNumberOfSteps(10);
      aby.addTickSpec(0, 0, true, "%1.0f");
      aby.addTickSpec(2, 1, false, null);
      aby.addTickSpec(3, 5, null);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
After the axes are created, the following code will draw them:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      graph.draw(abx.createAxis());
      graph.draw(aby.createAxis());
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
To complete the graph, first step is to create something to draw:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      Line2D line = new Line2D.Double(10.0, 10.0, 490.0, 350.0);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
To draw the shape created, a graphics context (an instance of
{@link java.awt.Graphics2D} has to be configure to provide a drawing
color and a stroke width. Once that is done, the shape can be drawn:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      Graphics2D g2d = graph.createGraphics();
      g2d.setColor(Color.BLACK);
      g2d.setStroke(new BasicStroke(1.5F));
      graph.draw(g2d, line);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
By using the {@link Graph} method
{@link Graph#draw(java.awt.Graphics2D,java.awt.Shape)},
The shape's boudary will use graph coordinate space units and the
width of the stroke used to draw it will use user-space units.
<P>
To output the graph, use
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      g2d.write("png", "graph.png");
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
for image-file formats
or
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      g2d.write();
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
for SVG, Postscript, or any case in which an instance of
{@link org.bzdev.gio.OutputStreamGraphics} was used in the
graph's constructor.

<H3><A NAME="log"></A>Creating a logarithmic axis</H3>

If an axis is a logarithmic axis, the values plotted on that
axis should be the logarithm to base 10 of the value to be
plotted. The corresponding values passed to
{@link org.bzdev.graphs.Graph#setRanges(double,double,double,double)}
should similarly be the logarithm to base 10 of the values at the
limits of the range. With the X axis as an example, where the X values
go from 0.1 to 100.0 and the Y values go from 0.0 to 40.0, the range
is set by
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      graph.setRanges(-1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 40.0);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
and the X axis is created by
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      AxisBuilder.Log ab =
         new AxisBuilder.Log(graph, -1.0, 0.0, 3.0, true, "X Axis");
      ab.addTickSpec(0, true, "%1.1f");
      ab.addTickSpec(2, 1);
      graph.draw(ab.createAxis());
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="clock"></A>Creating as clock-time graphs</H3>
When a distance of 1.0 in user space corresponds to one second in
time, on can use the class {@link AxisBuilder.ClockTime} to create
an axis:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      AxisBuilder.ClockTime abct =
      new AxisBuilder.ClockTime(graph, 0.0, 0.0, MKS.hours(1.0), true,
                                "Time (minutes)");
      abct.setSpacings(AxisBuilder.Spacing.SECONDS,
                       AxisBuilder.Spacing.MINUTES);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The origin of the axis will be (0,0) in GCS units, and the length will
be one hour (3600 seconds). The axis will be horizontal, and the axis
will have a label, "Time".
<P>
Next a series of tick specifications are added.  The format
string syntax is defined in the initial description of the
class {@link AxisBuilder.ClockTime}.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      abct.addTickSpec(0, AxisBuilder.Spacing.MINUTES, "%3$d");
      ab.addTickSpec(1, AxisBuilder.Spacing.THIRTY_SECONDS);
      ab.addTickSpec(2, AxisBuilder.Spacing.FIFTEEN_SECONDS);
      ab.addTickSpec(3, AxisBuilder.Spacing.TEN_SECONDS);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Finally the axis is added to the graph.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      graph.draw(abct.createAxis());
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="symbols"></A>Adding symbols</H3>

The {@link org.bzdev.graphs} package predefines a set of
symbols (more can be added by using a
{@Link org.bzdev.graphs.spi service provider interface}).
<P>
  One will first create a symbol factory, possibly configure
  it, perhaps to change a symbol's color, and then create a
  symbol, looking up the symbol by name (names can be found
  by calling {@link Graph.SymbolFactory#getSymbolNames()}):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      Graph.SymbolFactory sf = new Graph.SymbolFactory();
      Graph.Symbol symbol1 = sf.newSymbol("SolidCircle");
      sf.setColor(Color.RED);
      Graph.Symbol symbol2 = sf.newSymbol("SolidCircle");
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
To draw a symbol, one will use on the of the following
methods:
<UL>
  <LI>{@link Graph#draw(Graph.Symbol,double,double)}. This method
    draws a symbol without error bars.
  <LI>{@link Graph#drawEX(Graph.Symbol,double,double,double)}. This method
    draws a symbol with symmetric error bars in the X direction
  <LI>{@link Graph#drawEX(Graph.Symbol,double,double,double,double)}.
    This method draws a symbol with asymmetric error bars in the X direction.
  <LI>{@link Graph#drawEXY(Graph.Symbol,double,double,double,double)}.
    This method draws a symbol with symmetric error bars in the X and
    Y directions.
  <LI>{@link Graph#drawEXY(Graph.Symbol,double,double,double,double,double,double)}.
    This method draws a symbol with asymmetric error bars in the X
    and Y directions.
  <LI>{@link Graph#drawEY(Graph.Symbol,double,double,double)}. This method
    This method draws a symbol with symmetric error bars in the X direction.
  <LI>{@link Graph#drawEY(Graph.Symbol,double,double,double,double)}.
    This method draws a symbol with asymmetric error bars in the X direction.
</UL>
For example,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      graph.draw(symbol1, 100.0, 150.0)
      graph.drawEY(symbol2, 150.0, 200.0, 20.0);
      graph.drawEY(symbol2, 200.0, 200.0, 10.0, 15.0);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="overlays"></A>Overlays</H3>

The use of graph coordinate space as described, particularly when axes
are added to a graph, does not work very well when curves with different
units are displayed on the same graph (for example, pressure and temperature).
This can be handled by creating a second graph as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      Graph graph2 = new Graph(graph1, true);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The argument <CODE>graph1</CODE> indicates that <CODE>graph2</CODE>
will have the same dimensions as <CODE>graph1</CODE> and the argument
<CODE>true</CODE> indicates that both graph1 and graph2 share the same
image buffer or output stream. The graphs <CODE>graph1</CODE> and
<CODE>graph2</CODE> can be configured using the setRanges method to
have different mappings from user space to graph coordinate space.
When the graph is finally drawn, using either graph for output, the
resulting graph will reflect what was drawn for both of the two
graphs.

<H3><A NAME="drawing"></A>Using graphs as canvases</H3>

When used for drawing, the method
{@link Graph#setRanges(double,double,double,double,double,double)}
will normally be used. Its arguments are
<UL>
  <LI><CODE>xgcs</CODE>. The X coordinate in graph coordinate space for
    a reference point.
  <LI><CODE>ygcs</CODE>. The X coordinate in graph coordinate space for
    a reference point.
  <LI><CODE>xf</CODE>. The fractional position in the X direction of the
    reference point (0.0 is the left edge and 1.0 is the right edge).
  <LI><CODE>yf</CODE>.
  <LI><CODE>scaleFactorX</CODE>. The scale factor for the X direction.
    This is the number by which to multiple a difference in graph
    coordinate space in the X direction to obtain the corresponding
    difference in user space.
  <LI><CODE>scaleFactorY</CODE>. The scale factor for the Y direction.
    This is the number by which to multiple a difference in graph
    coordinate space in the Y direction to obtain the corresponding
    difference in user space.
</UL>
Typically offsets will be set to zero (the default) as there is no need to
leave room for axes. For example,
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      graph.setRanges(0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, sf, sf);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
will place (0.0, 0.0) in graph coordinate space at the center of the
graph.  For drawings of 2D objects, the X and Y scale factors will
typically be identical.
<P>
Drawing in Java requires obtaining an instance of
{@link java.awt.Graphics2D}.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      Graphics2D g2d = graph.createGraphics();
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Once obtained, one can configure various properties such as
colors and strokes.  When used with a {@link Graph} draw method,
the positions of points are provided in graph coordinate space
whereas stroke width are provided in user-space units.  For example
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      g2d.setColor(Color.BLACK);
      g2d.setStroke(new BasicStroke(2.0F));
      Shape shape = ...;
      graph.draw(g2d, shape);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
will draw the outline of a shape, assuming it's points represent
GCS values, using a stroke width of 2 points in user space.
<P>
By contrast, the following declaration:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      Graphics2D g2dGCS = graph.createGraphicsGCS();
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
will create a graphics context that will always use graph coordinate
space:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><PRE>
      g2dGCS.setColor(Color.BLACK);
      g2dGCS.setStroke(new BasicStroke(2.0F));
      Shape shape = ...;
      g2dGCS.draw(shape);
</PRE></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
will draw the same shape as in the previous example, but
with the stroke's width numerically equal to 2.0 in graph coordinate
space, not user space.

<H1>The org.bzdev.geom package</H1>

This package augments the java.awt.geom package and additionally
provides some classes for 3D geometry.
The class hierarchy is shown in the following diagram, with a class
from the java.awt.geom package shown in blue.

For the classes in this package associated with two-dimensional
graphics, the class
<ul>
 <li> {@link Path2DInfo} provides information
   about instances of java.awt.geom.Path2D.  This includes the values
   of ds/du and d<sup>2</sup>s/du<sup>2</sup> at a given value of u,
   the length of a path segment, and a list of entries describing the
   segments of a path, where each entry contains
   <ul>
     <li> an index indicating the segment's position in the path.
     <li> the starting point of the segment.
     <li> the ending point of the segment.
     <li> the length of the segment.
     <li> the coordinates of the segment (the x and y positions of
       the end points and the control points)
     <li> the type of the segment
     <li> a string representation of the type of a segment (useful
       for printing debugging information)
   </ul>
 <li> {@link SplinePath2D} extends
      Path2D.Double to provide a B&eacute;zier splines connecting a
      sequence of points, implemented as a sequence of cubic
      B&eacute;zier path segments. The user provides a sequence of end
      points and a splineTo method computes the locations of the
      control points for each segment.
 <li> {@link BasicSplinePath2D}
   extends {@link SplinePath2D} by
   providing a parameterized curve whose parameter u covers the range
   [0.0, 1.0) for the first segment, [1.0, 2.0) for the second
   segment, etc.  The curve must be continuous: only one MOVE_TO
   operation is allowed and only the last segment may be closed.  This
   class provides methods for computing a point along the curve given
   its parameter. First and second derivatives can also be
   computed. Additional methods compute the length of the path between
   two values of the parameter and allow the parameter to be computed
   given the length from the start of the curve.  The path length will
   be negative if the final value of the path parameter is smaller
   than its initial value.  For closed paths, there is no upper limit
   on the parameter - one may traverse the path as many times as
   desired.
 <li> {@link SplinePathBuilder}
   simplifies the creation of
   a {@link SplinePath2D} and is used by
   some of the factory classes in the anim2d package.
 <li> {@link BasicSplinePathBuilder}
   simplifies the creation of a
   {@link BasicSplinePath2D} and is
   used by some of the factory classes in the anim2d package.
</ul>
<p>
For the classes in this package associated with three-dimensional
graphics, there are four interfaces:
<UL>
 <li> {@link PathIterator3D}. This
   interface provides a set of methods for iterating over the segments
   that make up a path.  The interface is nearly identical to that
   provided by java.awt.geom.PathIterator. The differences are
   that there is no method to get a winding rule (because a winding
   rule does not make sense in a three dimensional space), and the
   documentation for the currentSegment methods differs as the array
   size is larger for three dimensions than for two dimensions.
 <li> {@link Shape3D}. This interface provides
   common methods for two-dimensional shapes that are embedded in a
   three-dimensional space.  These methods produce a bounding box and
   and an iterator.
 <li> {@link SurfaceIterator}.  This
   interface provides the methods needed to iterate over a surface
   embedded in a three-dimensional space.
 <li> {@link Transform3D}. This interface
   provides the methods needed to apply a transform plus a method to
   generate an affine transform that approximates the transform in a
   sufficiently small neighborhood of a specified point.
</UL>
The classes associated with three-dimensional graphics are:
<UL>
 <li> {@link AffineTransform3D}. This
   class provides affine transformations in a three dimensional
      space, analogous to the affine transforms provided by
      java.awt.geom.AffineTransform.
 <li> {@link Path3DInfo}. This class provides
      a similar set of methods as {@link Path2DInfo},
      but for a three-dimensional space rather than a two-dimensional
      space.
 <li> {@link Path3D}.  This class provides paths
   in a three-dimensional space that consist of segments of straight
   lines, quadratic B&eacute;zier curves, and cubic B&eacute;zier
   curves.  As with the class java.awt.geom.Path2D, a path may
   consist of several separate components (separated by MOVETO
   operations), and a component may be open or closed.
 <li> {@link Point3D}. This class provides a
   representation of points in a three-dimensional space.  The
   subclasses Point3D.Float and Point3D.Double store the points using
   single and double precision floating point numbers respectively.
 <li> {@link Rectangle3D}. This class
   provides a cuboid whose edges are lines for which either X and Y, Y
   and Z, or X and Z coordinates are constant.
 <li> {@link Surface3D}. This class represents
   two-dimensional surfaces embedded in a three-dimensional space.
   The subclasses {@link Surface3D.Float}
   and {@link Surface3D.Double} store
   data describing the surface using single and double precision
   floating point numbers respectively.
</UL>
These classes and interfaces, to the extend possible, mimic the API
provide by similar classes in the package java.awt.geom in order to
reduce the learning curve for programmers - those using these classes
are likely to be familiar with the classes in java.awt.geom.

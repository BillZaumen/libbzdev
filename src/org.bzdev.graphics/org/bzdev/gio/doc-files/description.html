<H1>The org.bzdev.gio package</H1>

This package provides classes to generate graphics in various
output formats and  write them to an output stream. The constructor for
{@link OutputStreamGraphics}
cannot be called directly. Instead, the method
{@link OutputStreamGraphics#newInstance(java.io.OutputStream,int,int,java.lang.String)}
should be used.  This will create an instance of a subclass of
{@link OutputStreamGraphics} based
on image&apos;s type.  After an instance is created, a user will typically
call {@link OutputStreamGraphics#createGraphics}
to get a Graphics2D object for drawing and will perform a series of
drawing operations using multiple graphics contexts if necessary or
convenient.  When done, the user will call the method
{@link OutputStreamGraphics#imageComplete()}
and the image will be written to the output stream in the appropriate
format.
<P>
The image formats recognized by Java (e.g., PNG and JPEG) are handled
by creating a BufferedImage, using Graphics2D operations to create the
image, and then using ImageIO methods to write to the output stream.
For Postscript graphics and other formats, Java uses mechanisms
associated with printing, and the objects appearing in the output may
have to be printed multiple times.  The basic functionality for this
is handled by the
class {@link ThreadedOSGraphics}.
The class {@link Graphics2DRecorder}
allows this to be done by replaying the Graphics2D operations as many
times as needed. The
interface {@link GraphicsCreator}
specifies a single method (createGraphics) in order to provide a
standard interface for generating new instances of Graphics2D.
<P>
A class diagram is shown below (non-public classes are shown in blue):

The class RecordingGraphics2D (which is not public)
is an inner class of
{@link Graphics2DRecorder} and is the
Graphics2D object used when subclasses of ThreadedOSGraphics, or other
classes that require the same image to be produced multiple times, are
used.  These classes requires the user to provide a "paint" method and
the implementation will provide a graphics context. ThreadedOSGraphics
provides the threads and hides the multiple calls to the paint method
from the user of these classes.
<P>
The class {@link PrinterGraphics}
provides Graphics2D operations that will produce output for a
printer. The
interface {@link OSGraphicsOps} provides
the methods needed to use most of the classes in this package. The
typical sequence of operations is to call the method
{@link OSGraphicsOps#createGraphics()}
in order to obtain an instance of java.awt.Graphics2D, use
that instance to draw the desired graphics, and then finally call
{@link OSGraphicsOps#imageComplete()} }
to draw the graphics on an the output file or device. When the output
is written to an output stream, one will typically use one of the
OutputStreamGraphics methods named newInstance to create the
appropriate subclass of OutputStreamGraphics.  For printing, one must
use the constructor for the class
{@link PrinterGraphics}.  The
class {@link org.bzdev.swing.PanelGraphics}
implements the {@link OSGraphicsOps}
interface and can be used to draw objects so that they will appear in
a panel.  {@link org.bzdev.swing.PanelGraphics}
has some static methods that will create window containing this panel,
with optionally some buttons that will allow the contents to be
written to a file or printed.

Please see the <A HREF="#scripting">scripting example</A> section for
an example.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

As described in the
<A HREF="../package-summary.html">package summary</A>, this package,
which is based on the devqsim package, provides support for two
dimensional animations, typically "stick figures" or simple graphics
although any level of complexity is possible.  The class hierarchy is
illustrated in the following diagram:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="anim2d.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
Factory classes are mostly abstract and make use of generics
with a type parameter named Obj that extends the class paired
with the factory.  The classes that are not abstract add a
method that allows an object to be created. When new types
of animation objects  (subclasses of AnimationObject2D) are
added, the abstract factories can be extended, thus reducing
the amount of coding necessary to implement a factory.
<P>
To create an animation, one will create an instance of
Animation2D, specifying a frame rate, frame dimensions, and
some other parameters. The frame is represented by a graph in
graph coordinate space (as defined in the package org.bzdev.graphs),
and objects in the animation are typically described in graph
coordinate space, thus allowing units appropriate for an
application to be used directly.
<P>
All objects that appear in the animation will be instances of
AnimationObject2D, which defines a 'z-order' value to set the
stacking order of objects, and a boolean flag to indicate if the
object is currently visible when within the frame.  The class
AnimationLayer2D allows layers to be added to a frame.  These are
static unless a subclass overrides the default behavior.
<P>
Movable objects can be coded directly, or as subclasses of
DirectedObject2D or PlacedObject2D. A special subclass of
DirectedObject2D exists called GraphView.  This sets the
position of a frame in graph coordinate space, and allows the
frame to follow a path and zoom in or out.  Only one instance
of GraphView should be used at a time. Two other special-purpose
classes are CartesianGrid2D and PolarGrid, which add a grid to
an animation, often as a reference aid while an animation is being
developed.

<H2><A ID="scripting"></A>Scripting example</H2>

When scripting is used, animation objects are typically created
using factories: a concise notation using scripting-language objects
allows these to be created easily. A description of how to configure a
factory is in the documentation for
{@link org.bzdev.obnaming.NamedObjectFactory}.
<P>
For example the following script, which is assumed to be
executed by the program scrunner, will create an animation.
When scrunner executes a script, it predefines a variable
named <CODE>scripting</CODE>, which is an instance of the
class {@link org.bzdev.scripting.ExtendedScriptingContext}.
<CODE>ExtendedScriptingContext</CODE> contains methods
for importing classes: how to do this varies from one
scripting-language implementation to another, even for the
same language, so having a standard method makes scripts
more portable. It is also useful to set a variable that will
allow one to write to standard output, again for similar reasons:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.anim2d.Animation2D");
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.anim2d.KinematicOps2D");
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.swing.AnimatedPanelGraphics");
scripting.importClass("org.bzdev.util.units.MKS");
var out = scripting.getWriter();
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
If the ESP scripting language is used, the 'scripting' statements
should be followed by
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
###
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
so that the imports are processed before the rest of the file is
scanned.  Alternatively, for ESP, one may use its 'import' statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
import (org.bzdev.anim2d.Animation2D);
import (org.bzdev.anim2d.KinematicOps2D);
import (org.bzdev.swing.AnimatedPanelGraphics);
import (org.bzdev.util.units.MKS);
var out = scripting.getWriter();
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
in which case the line with '###' is not needed.
<P>
The next step is to create an animation. The construct uses the
frame dimensions, the number of ticks per second, and the
number of ticks per frame. Dividing the number of ticks per second
by the number of ticks per frame yields the frame rate (the number
of frames per second), which in this case is 25 frames per second.
To further configure the frame, we need define the mapping between
user space and graph coordinate space (these are defined in the
documentation for {@link org.bzdev.graphs.Graph}). This mapping is
set up by calling
{@link org.bzdev.anim2d.Animation2D#setRanges(double,double,double,double,double,double)}:
<UL>
  <LI> the first argument is the X coordinate for the origin in graph
    coordinates space units.
  <LI>the second argument is the Y coordinate for the origin in graph
    coordinates space units.
  <LI> the third argument is the fractional distance in the frame from
    left (0.0) to right (1.0) for  the origin.
  <LI> the fourth argument is the fractional distance in the frame from
    bottom (0.0) to top (1.0) for the origin.
  <LI> The fifth argument is the scale factor in the X direction. This
    scale factor is the ratio of the user-space distance to the
    corresponding distance in graph coordinate space.
  <LI> The sixth argument is the scale factor in the Y direction. This
    scale factor is also the ratio of the user-space distance to the
    corresponding distance in graph coordinate space units.
</UL>
When scale factors are measured off of an image, the program EPTS can
be used to determine the distances in user space between two points whose
separation in graph-coordinate space is known.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>


var frameWidth= 656.0;
var frameHeight = 569.0;

var a2d = new Animation2D(scripting, frameWidth, frameHeight, 1000.0, 40);
var idist = 76.8542;
var dist = MKS.feet(23.0);
var scalef = idist / dist;

a2d.setRanges(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, scalef, scalef);
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The variable <CODE>da</CODE>, when set, will usually be set by the scrunner
program based on a command-line argument.  Its value will be a
directory accessor. If a directory accessor is defined,
however, that directory can be used to open a file. The following code
handles the case where <CODE>da</CODE> is not defined by a variable
<CODE>apg</CODE> that will open a window that will display an animation
(such an animation, however, cannot be saved in a video format).
The class {@link org.bzdev.swing.AnimatedPanelGraphics} provides a GUI
component in which an animation can be displayed. The ECMAScript code
is
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>

if (typeof da === 'undefined') {
    var apg = AnimatedPanelGraphics.newFramedInstance(a2d,
						      "Roundabout",
						      true, true, null);
}
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
whereas the corresponding ESP code is
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>

var apg = var.da? null:
    AnimatedPanelGraphics.newFramedInstance(a2d, "Roundabout",
				            true, true, null);
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

To configure an animation, one will need several factories. The
following code creates factories by using the method
{@link org.bzdev.anim2d.Animation2D#createFactories(String,Object)}.
The first argument to <CODE>createFactories</CODE> is a package name
and the second is a scripting-language object. For ECMAScript, this
object consists of a series of properties, where a property's name is
the name of an ECMAScript variable that will reference the factor and
where the property's value is a string giving a simple name for the
class.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
a2d.createFactories("org.bzdev.anim2d", {
    alf: "AnimationLayer2DFactory",
    pathf: "AnimationPath2DFactory"
});

a2d.createFactories("org.bzdev.roadanim", {
    cf: "CarFactory",
});
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Because the createFactories method creates new scripting-language
variables, when using ESP these statements should be followed by
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
###
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
in order to create the variables before proceeding.
<P>
Next the factories are used to create objects that will appear in the
animation.  It is convenient to define a couple of variables
first: <CODE>BLUE</CODE> is an object used to specify the color blue
and <CODE>iscale</CODE> is a number that tells how an image should be
scaled.  Its value is the ratio of a dimension in graph coordinate
space to a corresponding distance in image space (basically user space
when the image is displayed on a screen). In this
example, <CODE>iscale</CODE> is the inverse of <CODE>fscale</CODE>
so that each pixel of the image has a width and height of 1/72".
The code then creates a background image using a PNG file with the
appropriate scaling. The URL searches for a resource given a search
path containing directories and/or JAR files that is set up on the
<CODE>scrunner</CODE> command line.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
var BLUE = {red: 0, green: 0, blue: 255};
var iscale = (dist/idist);

alf.createObject("background", [
    {visible: true},
    {zorder: 0},
    {withPrefix: "object", withIndex: [
	{type: "IMAGE",
	 imageURL: "resource:ross2.png",
	 refPoint: "LOWER_LEFT", x: 0.0, y: 0.00,
	 imageScaleX: iscale, imageScaleY: iscale}
]}]);

</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
A path that an object will follow is defined as well: the
variable <CODE>path1pts</CODE> contains the path specification
and is used by a factory to create the actual path.  In addition,
some variables are defined for common configuration options that
will be used later.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
var pathConfig = [
    {withPrefix: "color", config: BLUE},
    {withPrefix: "stroke", config: {width: 2.0, gcsMode: false}}
];

var carConfig = [
    {zorder: 3, visible: false},
    {refPointMode: "BY_NAME", refPointName: "UPPER_RIGHT"},
    {withPrefix: "color", config: BLUE}];

var path1pts = [
    {type: "MOVE_TO", x: 22.3025, y: 0.0912169},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 24.0813, y: 4.65206},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 26.9090, y: 13.3633},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 28.7789, y: 17.7873},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 30.5577, y: 20.1133},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 34.1607, y: 22.7586},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 36.3499, y: 25.9056},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 36.3499, y: 30.2840},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 35.2097, y: 32.0627},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 34.4344, y: 34.8448},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 34.8905, y: 37.0341},
    {type: "SPLINE", x: 37.4445, y: 44.6507},
    {type: "SEG_END", x: 39.7706, y: 51.8112},
    {type: "SEG_END", x: 49.7706,
     y: 51.8112 + 10*(51.8112 - 44.6507)/(39.7707-37.4445)}
    ];

var path1 = pathf.createObject("path1", [
    {zorder: 10, visible: false},
    pathConfig,
    {withPrefix: "cpoint", withIndex: path1pts}]);

</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
The next step is to create an animation object named <CODE>car</CODE>
a few useful variables are defined, and are used in the <CODE>car</CODE>
object's timeline.  Timelines are used to configure an object so that
the object's properties change at a specific time.

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
var toff = 0.2
var t1 = 0.2;

var tau = KinematicOps2D.timeGivenDVV(MKS.feet(50.0),
				      MKS.mph(25.0),
				      MKS.mph(10.0));

var accel = KinematicOps2D.accelGivenDVV(MKS.feet(50.0),
					 MKS.mph(25.0),
					 MKS.mph(10.0));

cf.createObject("car1", [
    carConfig,
    {withPrefix: "timeline", withIndex: [
	{time: t1, path: path1, velocity: MKS.mph(25.0), visible: true,
	 acceleration: accel},
	{time: t1+tau, acceleration: 0.0, velocity: MKS.mph(10)},
	{time: t1+tau+toff, acceleration: -accel},
	{time: t1+2*tau+toff, acceleration: 0.0, velocity: MKS.mph(25)}
    ]}
]);
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Finally, some methods are used to estimate the number of frames
needed, the simulation is configured to accept that many frames,
and the frames are added to the simulation. If the variable
<CODE>apg</CODE> was defined (which is the case when <CODE>da</CODE>
is not defined), the corresponding object is closed.  Closing it
indicates that all the frames it needs are ready so the animation can
start running.  The ECMAScript code is
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
var itau = 20.0;
var maxframes = a2d.estimateFrameCount(itau);
if (typeof da === 'undefined') {
    a2d.initFrames(maxframes, apg);
} else {
    a2d.initFrames(maxframes, "img", "png", da);
}
a2d.scheduleFrames(0, maxframes);

a2d.run();

if (!(typeof apg === 'undefined')) {
    apg.close();
}
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
whereas the ESP code is
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
var itau = 20.0;
var maxframes = a2d.estimateFrameCount(itau);
var.da? a2d.initFrames(maxframes, "img", "png", da):
    a2d.initFrames(maxframes, apg);

a2d.scheduleFrames(0, maxframes);

a2d.run();

var.da? void: apg.close();
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
To run this script, use
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
	scrunner -Dorg.bzdev.protocols.resource.path=images \
		 --codebase .../librdanim.jar  <U>FILE</U>
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
or
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
      mkdir -p tmp2
      rm -r tmp2/*.png
      scrunner -Dorg.bzdev.protocols.resource.path=images \
		 --codebase .../librdanim.jar -d:da tmp2  <U>FILE</U>
</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where <CODE><U>FILE</U></CODE> is video2.js if ECMAScript is used or
video2.esp if ESP is used.
The first option runs the animation without a directory accessor.
The second option provides a directory accessor (the <CODE>-d:da tmp2</CODE>
argument), and the specified directory will contain a number of PNG files
named in a way that allows the sequence to be determined.  The naming
convention used is recognized by VLC, ffmpeg, and similar programs,
allowing an animation in a standard format to be created.
<P>
<A HREF="https://youtu.be/yHJ0RCk62gE">A youtube video</A> shows a
more complete animation. The code above is a stripped-down version.
It was written as an experiment. At the time, the citizenry of a town
in California about 50 km south of San Francisco were up in arms about
a roundabout being installed to replace the four-way stop signs at an
intersection. In a city with nearly as many amateur traffic engineers
as citizens, the outcry was more like what one would expect after a
disaster of Biblical proportions. So the author put this animation up
on youtube to see if actually seeing how the thing works would reduce
the outcry.  It is not clear if it did&mdash;the more vocal people
tended to see only what fit their preconceptions&mdash;but after the
project was complete and people had actual experiences with the new
facility, the complaints evaporated. The model for vehicles was
written as the result of a minor fender bender. An animation helped an
insurance company's representative understand exactly what a
customer meant and why it was obviously the other driver's fault.

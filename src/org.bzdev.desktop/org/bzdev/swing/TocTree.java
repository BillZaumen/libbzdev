/**
 * Interface for Table of Contents.
 * A table of contents is a hierarchical mapping between a series
 * of names and and a set of objects.  The hierarchy is a tree.
 * The method <code>addEntry</code> should be called to create the
 * root of a tree, followed by a call to <code>nextLevel</code> to
 * add children to the tree.  Each call to <code>nextLevel</code>
 * must be balanced by a call to <code>prevLevel</code>.  A call to
 * the method <code>entriesCompleted</code> indicates that the
 * table of contents is complete.  One may select particular rows
 * by calling <code>setSelectionWithAction</code>, whose argument
 * is an index into the displayable nodes in the tree, indexed by
 * the order of entry. See {@link javax.swing.JTree} for a definition of
 * displayable versus visible.  A call to <code>clearSelection</code>
 * clears the current selection, and a call to <code>clearToc()</code>
 * clears the contents and puts the object in a state where a new
 * set of entries can be added.
 *<p>
 * The interface also supports action listeners, using the methods
 * <code>addActionListener</code> and <code>removeActionListener</code>.
 * The source of an action listener is an instance of the class
 * <code> TocEntry</code>.

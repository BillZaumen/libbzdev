The controls are described below:

<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Use System Proxies</STRONG><DD>is a check box that, when
      selected, allows a system-specific proxy configuration file to
      be used to set up proxies.  Java documentation claims this has
      been done for Windows and the Gnome desktop. If a system does
      not support this option, the proxies can be manually set (the
      remaining configuration options apply only when this check box is
      not selected).
  <DT><STRONG>Configure HTTP Proxy</STRONG><DD>is a check box that,
      when selected and enabled, indicates that a proxy should be used
      for HTTP. The HTTP Proxy Host option must then
      be filled in.
  <DT><STRONG>HTTP Proxy Host</STRONG><DD>is a text field that
      contains the domain name of the HTTP proxy.
  <DT><STRONG>HTTP Proxy Port</STRONG><DD>is a text field that
      contains port that the HTTP proxy is configured to use.  The
      default value is 80.  If left empty, the default value is used.
  <DT><STRONG>Configure HTTPS Proxy</STRONG><DD>is a check box that,
      when selected and enabled, indicates that a proxy should be used
      for HTTPS. The HTTPS Proxy Host option must then be filled in.
  <DT><STRONG>HTTPS Proxy Host</STRONG><DD>is a text field that
      contains the domain name of the HTTPS proxy.
  <DT><STRONG>HTTPS Proxy Port</STRONG><DD>is a text field that
      contains port that the HTTPS proxy is configured to use. The
      default value is 443. If left empty, the default value is used.
  <DT><STRONG>Exclude from HTTP[S] Proxy</STRONG><DD>specifies hosts
      that do not use an HHTP or HTTPS proxy. Multiple hosts can be
      specified by separating them with the character "|". In addition
      a wildcard character "*" can be used to indicate an arbitrary
      host: for example, "*.foo.com" would indicate any host whose
      domain name ends in ".foo.com".
  <DT><STRONG>Configure FTP Proxy</STRONG><DD>is a check box that,
      when selected and enabled, indicates that a proxy should be used
      for FTP. The FTP Proxy Host option must then be filled in.
  <DT><STRONG>FTP Proxy Host</STRONG><DD>is a text field that contains
      the domain name of the FTP proxy.
  <DT><STRONG>FTP Proxy Port</STRONG><DD>is a text field that contains
      port that the FTP proxy is configured to use. The default value
      is 80 (in the Java implementation, HTTP is used to contact the
      proxy). If left empty, the default value is used.
  <DT><STRONG>Exclude from FTP Proxy</STRONG><DD>specifies hosts that
      do not use an HHTP or HTTPS proxy. Multiple hosts can be
      specified by separating them with the character "|". In addition
      a wildcard character "*" can be used to indicate an arbitrary
      host: for example, "*.foo.com" would indicate any host whose
      domain name ends in ".foo.com".
  <DT><STRONG>Configure SOCKS Proxy</STRONG><DD>is a check box that,
      when selected and enabled, indicates that a proxy should be used
      for SOCKS. The SOCKS Proxy Host and Proxy Port options must then
      be filled in.
  <DT><STRONG>SOCKS Proxy Host</STRONG><DD>is a text field that
      contains the domain name of the SOCKS proxy.
  <DT><STRONG>SOCKS Proxy Port</STRONG><DD>is a text field that
      contains port that the SOCKS proxy is configured to use.
  <DT><STRONG>Save &amp; Accept Preferences</STRONG><DD>when clicked,
      the current configuration is saved an used.
  <DT><STRONG>Accept Preferences</STRONG><DD>when clicked, the current
      configuration is used but not saved permanently.
  <DT><STRONG>Cancel Preference Changes</STRONG><DD>when clicked,
      cancels the changes since the window became visible.

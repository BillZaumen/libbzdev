<H2>The org.bzdev.swing package</H2>

This package contains additional swing components and
various support classes as shown in the following
two  UML diagrams.  The first diagram, the more complex of the
two, contains most of the classes and interfaces in this package:

The second diagram shows various "button" classes and transfer
handlers that support Drag and Drop (D&amp;D):

The classes contained in this package can be grouped as
follows:
<UL>
 <LI> classes that display graphics and animations. These classes,
      are not swing components, but have a swing component associated
      with each instance. The use of these classes for creating
      graphics is thread safe. These classes are
      <UL>
        <LI>{@link AnimatedPanelGraphics}.
          This class can be used by
	  {@link org.bzdev.anim2d.Animation2D}
	  to display animations directly without having to first
	  create a series of frames and then use video editors or
	  programs such as ffmpeg to create a standard video
	  format. It implements the {@link org.bzdev.gio.ISWriterOps}
	  interface, so that it can be used interchangeably with
	  {@link org.bzdev.gio.ImageSequenceWriter}, which implements
	  the same interface.
        <LI>{@link PanelGraphics}. This
          class can be used to display a graph directly. It implements
          the {@link org.bzdev.gio.OSGraphicsOps}
          interface, which
	  {@link org.bzdev.gio.OutputStreamGraphics}
          also implements. For cases such as simulations with long
          running times, {@link PanelGraphics}
          supports incremental updating of graphs by "flushing" a
          partially completed display.
      </UL>
 <LI> classes that help implement transfer handlers to
      support D&amp;D with some allowing
      JLists to be reordered. These are
      <UL>
        <LI> {@link ExtObjTransferHandler}.
	  This transfer handler can be used to implement a target for
	  drag and drop operations.  The objects transferred are
	  identified by file names or by URLs.
        <LI> {@link ExtObjListTransferHandler}.
	  This is similar to
	  {@link ExtObjTransferHandler},
	  but the target
	  is a JList, and D&amp;D can be used to reorder that
	  JList. If the objects are defined to be subclasses of
	  ImageIcon, an image can be displayed in the JList.
        <LI> {@link ReorderListTransferHandler}.
	  This TransferHandler allows a JList to be reordered, but
	  does not provide support for inserting elements into that
	  JList: insertions have to be handle by another mechanism
	  (e.g. a "new item" button or menu item).
        <LI> {@link URLListTransferHandler}.
	  This transfer handler allows URLs and file names to be
	  dragged into a JList and allows that JList to be reordered.
        <LI> {@link DebugTransferHandler}.
	  This transfer handler is a wrapper for other transfer
	  handlers and simply adds tracing support for various
	  methods. Experience with some JDK/Desktop implementations
	  has shown that the data flavors in drag and drop operations
	  may be dependent on both the OS, the window system, and the
	  JDK.  For debugging purposes, determining what data flavors
	  are actually being used is useful.
      </UL>
 <LI> classes that provide thread-safe components. These are
      <UL>
        <LI> {@link SimpleJTextPane}.
	  This provides a text pane with simple formatting options
	  (e.g., font colors and a choice of text styles including
	  bold and italic). It is meant for console-like input and can
	  be configured to be thread safe.
        <LI> {@link SimpleConsole}.  A
	  console that can be displayed on demand and that includes a
	  method for creating a menu item that will make the console
	  visible.
      </UL>
 <LI> classes that provide components with restricted inputs.
      These are
      <UL>
        <LI> {@link VTextField}. A text field that verifies its input and
             only replaces an old value if the new value is acceptable.
        <LI> {@link WholeNumbTextField}.
	  A text field that allows only whole numbers to be entered.
        <LI> {@link PortTextField}.  A
	  text field whose legal values are the legal values for TCP
	  or UDP port numbers.
        <LI> {@link TimeTextField}.  A
	  text field representing time intervals and accepting a
	  variety of input formats.
      </UL>
 <LI> classes to support internationalized menus.  These are
      <UL>
        <LI> {@link IMenu}. A menu whose label
	  adjusts to a specified locale.
        <LI> {@link IMenuItem}.  A whose
	  properties adjust to a specified locale.
        <LI> {@link ProxyMenuItem}.  A
	  menu item for configuring proxies, with support for
	  internationalization.
        <LI> {@link HelpMenuItem}.  A menu
	  item for creating simple on-line help with support for
	  internationalization.
        <LI> {@link StackTraceMenuItem}.
	  A menu item for turning on and off stack traces when using
	  the ErrorMessage class for printing errors.
        <LI>
      </UL>
 <LI> classes that provide buttons to open dialog boxes for
      inputting text. These are
      <UL>
        <LI> {@link TextAreaButton}.  A
	  button that will bring up a text area for input.
        <LI> {@link TextFieldButton}.  A
	  button that will bring up a text field for input.
        <LI> {@link URLTextAreaButton}.
	  A button that will bring up a text field for input possibly
	  obtaining the text by downloading text specified by a URL.
      </UL>
 <LI> classes that map named JTree entries to objects. These are
      <UL>
        <LI> {@link ObjTocPane}.  This
	  component provides a hierarchical table of contents for a
	  set of objects. Action listeners are used to track changes
	  in selections.
        <LI> {@link UrlTocPane}.  This
	  component extends ObjTocPane by specializing it so that the
	  objects it manages are URLs. It's action listeners can
	  detect which URL was selected and respond in some
	  appropriate way.
      </UL>
 <LI> a class {@link HtmlWithTocPane}
   that combine a JTree with a JEditorPane for displaying HTML
   document.
 <LI> A class {@link AuthenticationPane}
   for password authentication, with an option of showing text as a
   password is typed or hiding text.
 <LI> A class {@link HtmlPane} for displaying
   HTML text with navigation controls.
 <LI> A {@link SwingErrorMessage} class that
   can send messages to various destinations including an instance of
   {@link SimpleConsole}.  System.err,
   etc., are also supported.
</UL>
In addition there are four related packages:
<UL>
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.swing.io}.
    This contains a Reader that can read from instances of
    java.swing.text.Document.
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.swing.keys}.
    This contains a class that provides only static methods and that
    can look up key events by name.
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.swing.text}.
    This contains a DocumentFilter, and two tread-safe Document
    classes.
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.swing.proxyconf}.
    This contains classes for configuring network proxies.

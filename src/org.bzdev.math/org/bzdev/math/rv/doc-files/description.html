<H2>The org.bzdev.math.rv package</H2>

This package contains classes that implement random variables. For
extensibility, these random-variable classes implement the
interface {@link org.bzdev.math.rv.RandomVariableRVOps}. There
are two additional interfaces:
<UL>
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.math.rv.RandomVariableRVOps} is implemented
    by random numbers that generate other random numbers.
  <LI> {@link org.bzdev.math.rv.RandomVariableRVNOps}  is implemented
    by random numbers that generate other random numbers that in
    turn generate numbers.
</UL>
<P>
Aside from constructors and a few access methods for purposes such as
printing statistics, and methods to implement range restrictions, one
simply calls the <code>next()</code> method to generate the next
random value.  The random numbers are generated by using the class
{@link org.bzdev.math.StaticRandom}, which has only static members.  A
range restriction may result in these static members being called
repeatedly until a value satisfying the range restriction is found.  A
range restriction is useful when a tail of a distribution contains
values that are not legal. For example a Gaussian random variable with
a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 0.1 can very rarely produce
a negative value.  If a negative value is not appropriate, a range
restriction can be used to avoid having to code this case explicitly.
<P>
There are also a series of classes for random variables whose
values are other random variables.  This is useful for factory
classes that need to configure a series of objects with random
variables that have different distributions without having to
modify the factory's methods.
<P>
The top-level classes for the class hierarchy are shown in the
following figure:

The base class is named {@link RandomVariable} and it has a type
parameter giving the type of the values it creates.  This is an
abstract class.  The classes {@link BooleanRandomVariable},
{@link IntegerRandomVariable}, {@link LongRandomVariable}, and
{@link DoubleRandomVariable} are also abstract classes that eliminate the
need to use a type parameter, and with the exception
of {@link BooleanRandomVariable}, each class implements range
restrictions and contains a method named rangeTestFailed that takes a
single argument of an appropriate type (int, long or double
respectively).  The method rangeTestFailed should be called by code
that implements the method next() when a range restriction is
supported. Unless next is to return a value other than a boolean, int,
long, or double, subclasses implementing a new type of random variable
should be subclasses of either {@link BooleanRandomVariable},
{@link IntegerRandomVariable}, {@link LongRandomVariable}, or
{@link DoubleRandomVariable}. There is one existing class in this
category: {@link InterarrivalTimeRV}, which is a subclass of
{@link LongRandomVariable}. {@link InterarrivalTimeRV} restricts the
values a random variable generates to non-negative long integers. In
addition, it simplifies the use of generic types (for example, in the
package {@link org.bzdev.devqsim.rv}).
<P>
The abstract
class {@link RandomVariableRV} has two
type parameters. The first specifies a type T, and the second
specifies a random variable class RV that is a subclass of
RandomVariable&lt;T&gt;.  The
class {@link RandomVariableRVN}, which
is a subclass of RandomVariableRV&lt;T,RV&gt; restricts T to be a
subclass of Number.  The
classes {@link BooleanRandomVariableRV},
{@link IntegerRandomVariableRV},
{@link LongRandomVariableRV}, and
{@link DoubleRandomVariableRV}
have a single type parameter that gives the class of the random
variable that a call to next() should return. For example, the class
{@link GaussianRVRV} is a subclass of
DoubleRandomVariableRV&lt;GaussianRV&gt;,
while {@link GaussianRV} is a subclass of
{@link DoubleRandomVariable}.
{@link GaussianRVRV} takes two random
variables as arguments to its constructor, and these are used to
generate the arguments to the constructor
for {@link GaussianRV}, and instance of which
is returned when next() is called on an instance
of {@link GaussianRVRV}.
<P>
There are a number of classes to provide random variables with
specific distributions.  A partial class hierarchy is shown in
the following figure:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="partial.png">
<P>
These include are classes to produce random variables with a fixed
distribution which provides a single value, a uniform distribution,
and a deterministic distribution, for boolean, integer, long, and
double values.
<P>
The classes {@link GaussianRV},
{@link LogNormalRV}, and
{@link ExpDistrRV} provide subclasses
of {@link DoubleRandomVariable} for
Gaussian, log-norm. and exponential distributions.  The class
InterarrivalTimeRV provides a class for interarrival times in which
time is represented by a long.  Its subclasses are
BinomialIATimeRV, DeterminIATimeRV, FixedIATimeRV, GaussianIATimeRV,
PoissonIATimeRV, and UniformIATimeRV.
<P>
Similarly, the following figure shows a partial class
hierarchy for random variables that generate other random variables:
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="rvrv.png">
<P>
These classes are used primarily with factories that initialize
multiple objects, each with a random variable with a different
distribution function.
<P>
One class does not fit the pattern described above:
{@link GaussianRVs}.
This class creates a vector of correlated random variables.

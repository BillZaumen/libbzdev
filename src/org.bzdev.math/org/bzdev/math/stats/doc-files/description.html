<H2>The org.bzdev.math.stats package</H2>

This package contains several statistics-related classes.
The class hierarchy is shown in the following diagram:

<P>
One will typically use the stats package as follows:
<UL>
   <LI> In the simplest case, a program such as a simulation
     will produce data providing a mean value and standard
     deviation for quantities such as queue lengths. The class
     {@link BasicStats} or
     {@link BasicStatsMV} can be used to
     record this data and then compute the mean and standard
     deviation.  A table of means and standard deviations can then be
     used as the input for a least-squares fit.
   <LI> If an application produces an array of non-deterministic
        values, computing this array multiple times, the class
        {@link CovarianceMatrix} can be
        used to compute the covariance matrix.  One of two subclasses
        will be used:
        <UL>
           <LI> {@link CovarianceMatrix.Population}
                when the data sets represent the full population.
           <LI> {@link CovarianceMatrix.Sample}
                when the data sets are a representative sample.
        </UL>
        In both cases, the data can be collected and then passed to
        a constructor the data can be added incrementally.
   <LI> For hypothesis testing, the standard terminology refers to
        a null hypothesis (denoted H<sub>0</sub>) and an alternate
        hypothesis, (denoted as H<sub>A</sub> or possibly H<sub>1</sub>,
        etc. as there may be several).  The null hypothesis is a
        hypothesis one attempts to disprove (the word "null" is used
        because "nullify" is used as a synonym for "disprove"). For
        example, the null hypothesis might be that the mean value of
        some quantity is zero, while the alternate hypothesis may be
        that the mean is larger than some value &mu;. The test makes
        use of a statistic - a real-valued function of the data. Often
        the statistic is chosen so that its value is zero when the
        probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is at its minimum
        value. A statistic has an associated probability distribution
        that represents the probability that a random variable will
        produce a specific outcome when the null hypothesis is in fact
        true. The following quantities are used with respect to the
        null hypothesis:
        <UL>
           <LI> The p value is the probability that the random variable
                associated with a statistic will have a value at least
                as extreme (e.g., as far from zero).  The term "extreme"
                can refer to deviations from zero in one or both
                directions.
           <LI> The symbol &alpha; is typically used to indicate a cutoff
                value for the p value.  For example if &alpha;=0.01, there
                is a one percent chance of the random variable generating
                a value at least this extreme. The value of &alpha; is
                the probability of a type I error, defined as the probability
                that the null hypothesis is in fact true when the test
                indicated that it is false.
           <LI> For a given value of &alpha;, the statistic's critical
                value is the value of the statistic for which the
                p value would be numerically equal to &alpha;.  depending
                on the situation, one may use one or two critical values.
                (two values allows for deviations in both directions from
                zero).
        </UL>
        The probability distribution for the alternate hypothesis
        can also be computed by providing a noncentrality
        parameter.  This parameter, when it exists, is used to
        initialize the probability distribution for the alternate
        hypothesis, and its definition is dependent on the
        statistic and distribution used. Methods that help compute
        the noncentrailty parameter exist but these methods may
        throw an UnsupportedOperationException if the
        statistic's distribution does not have a noncentrality
        parameter or if the specific method is not appropriate.
        Each statistic that supports such a method should document
        the use of such methods.  The use of a noncentral
        distribution allows the same statistic to be used for both
        hypotheses. The following quantities are used with respect
        to the alternate hypothesis:
        <UL>
            <LI> The value &beta; is the integral of the
                 probability density of a statistic for the
                 probability distribution associated with an
                 alternate hypothesis, with the limits of
                 integration equal to the critical values for the
                 null hypothesis.  This measures the probability of
                 the null hypothesis being accepted when the
                 alternate hypothesis is in fact true. Such an
                 outcome is referred to as a type II error.
            <LI> The statistical power is defined as 1 - &beta; and
                 indicates the probability that the null hypothesis
                 has not been falsely rejected given that the null
                 hypothesis has been rejected.
            <LI> The alternate hypothesis is sometimes
                 characterized by providing the mean value of some
                 quantity or its difference from the value assumed
                 by the null hypothesis.  The value of &beta; is a
                 function of this quantity.
        </UL>
        When using this package for hypothesis testing, one will typically
        do the following:
        <OL>
            <LI> Create an instance of a subclass of Statistic, choosing
                 the subclass that matches the statistic one chooses to use.
            <LI> Add data to the statistic, either when the constructor is
                 called or by calling various methods whose name starts with
                 the string "add".
            <LI> The method
                 {@link org.bzdev.math.stats.Statistic#getValue()}
                 will return the value of the statistic given the
                 data provided.
            <LI> The method
                 {@link org.bzdev.math.stats.Statistic#getPValue(org.bzdev.math.stats.Statistic.PValueMode)}
                 will determine the statistic's p value. This method's
                 argument will determine if a one-sided or two-sided value
                 is desired.  There are options for the one-sided case that
                 specify whether more extreme values are positive or
                 negative.
            <LI> One may also use methods to obtain critical values,
                 a distribution for an alternate hypothesis, and to
                 compute the quantity &beta; for a given alternate
                 hypothesis.  These methods are described in the
                 documentation for {@link org.bzdev.math.stats.Statistic}.
                 and its subclasses.
        </OL>
   <LI> For testing if a data set follows a particular distribution,
        one may use the class
        {@link org.bzdev.math.stats.KSStat}, which provides a
        Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to see if a data set can be
        described by a specified probability distribution. This
        test requires that the distribution does not make use of
        parameters that were calculated from the data set.
        A good use is to test new random number generators to
        verify that they follow the desired probability distribution.

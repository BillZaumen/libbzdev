<H1>The org.bzdev.math package</H1>

As stated in the package summary, the package org.bzdev.math
contains implementations of special functions,
algorithms for numerical quadrature, solutions to differential
equations, etc.
<P>
The class hierarchy is shown in the following diagrams. The
diagram
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="math1.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
shows the class hierarchy for numerical quadrature, root finding,
solving first-order differential equations, numerically stable
addition, matrix and vector operations, special functions, and
mathematical constants. The diagram
<P style="text-align: center">
<img src="math2.png" class="imgBackground" alt="Diagram">
<P>
shows the class hierarchy for classes that represent
double-precision real valued functions and functions that create
arrays of double-precision real numbers.  For the Functions class,
dependencies on its nested classes are shown.
<P>
For numerical quadrature, one class implements Gauss-Legendre
quadrature, and another implements Simpson's rule. Each is an
abstract class for which a function to integrate must be defined.
If the function's values are known at evenly-spaced points,
Simpson's rule may be used. If the function is well approximated by
a polynomial and can be evaluated at any arbitrary point,
Gauss-Legendre quadrature is very efficient as it requires
relatively few function evaluations.
<P>
The Runge-Kutta classes allow non-linear, first-order differential
equations to be solved numerically.  The class RungeKutta uses the
fourth order algorithm (often called the Runge-Kutta method as this
is the one most frequently used) to solve y' = f(t,y). The class
RungeKuttaMV replaces y with a vector (i.e., a Java array) to allow
systems of first-order differential equations to be solved.
<P>
The Functions class provides methods for computing various elementary and
special functions. This class has nested classes associated with
particular special functions.  The one for Legendre polynomials,
for example, has a method for calculating a polynomial's roots
and for computing a value for a particular argument for all
degrees up to some limit (this can be done efficiently due to a
recursion relationship).  Some constants are needed by the Functions
class.  These are defined by the class Constants, as they have additional
uses.  The functions provided are:
<UL>
 <li> Airy functions and their derivatives (while Airy functions can
      be computed by using Bessel functions of order 1/3, the
      implementation uses an infinite series that requires less
      computation).
 <li> Bernstein polynomials. These are used for B&eacute;zier curves
      and surface, and can also be used for interpolation methods.
 <li> Bessel functions (including spherical Bessel functions and
      modified Bessel functions) of the first and second kind, and
      their derivatives.  For spherical Bessel functions, the order
      is integer valued; otherwise the order can be either an integer
      or a double-precision number.
 <li> the Beta function.
 <li> binomial coefficients.  Methods allow long-integer values,
      double-precision values, and BigInteger values to be computed.
      When a long integer is returned, the time complexity is O(1).
      When a double-precision number is returned, the time complexity
      for computing C(n,m) is O(1) for n &lt; 512; otherwise it is
      O(1) for large m but O(m) for m &lt; 20. For the BigInteger case,
      BigInteger arrays are returned, one for each value of n.
 <li> factorials.  Methods include ones for returning double-precision
      values, long-integer values, and BigInteger values. An additional
      method computes the logarithm of a factorial. With the exception
      of the BigInteger case, the time complexity is 0(1) due to the use
      of table look-up and asymptotic expansions.
 <li> the gamma function and the digamma function.
 <li> inverse hyperbolic functions.
 <li> Laguerre polynomials and associated Laguerre polynomials, plus
      their derivatives.
 <li> Legendre polynomials and associated Legendre functions, plus
      their derivatives.
 <li> Spherical harmonics. As these are complex-valued functions,
      the values computed are multiplied by e<sup>-im&phi;</sup> so
      that the value returned is a real number.
 <li> the Riemann zeta function.
</UL>
The choice of functions is geared towards those used in classical
electrodynamics and elementary quantum mechanics: basically ones
that are used in solutions to certain ordinary and partial differential
equations.
<P>
The Binomial class provides static methods for computing binomial
coefficients. The method C returns C(n,m) as a long integer. The
method 'coefficient' computes C(n,m) as a double-precision real number.
The method logC computes the logarithm of C(n, m). The methods named
coefficients allow a table of binomial coefficients to be computed,
with the results represented as long integers.  The methods named
exactC allow a table of binomial coefficients to be computed with
the results represented by instances of BigInteger.  Normally users
will use the methods named 'C' or 'coefficient' - the implementation
is efficient due to the use of precomputed values and asymptotic
expansions.
<P>
The RootFinder class finds roots of functions given their derivatives
and for a function f(x), can solve the equation y = f(x) for x given
y (as the solution is the root of the equation g(x) = f(x) - y).
It has two nested classes, one using Newton's method and the other
using Halley's method.
 *<P>
The class RealValuedFunctionVA provides real-valued functions
(These return the primitive type <code>double</code>) that take an
arbitrary number of arguments (the constructors can provide upper
and lower bounds on the number of arguments). The methods allow
bother value of the function and the values of its first and second
derivatives to be computed. This class is useful when a function
should be passed as an argument. There are constructors that allow
the value and its derivatives to be defined via a scripting
language when that is convenient.  The class RealValuedFunction is
a subclass of RealValuedFunctionVA that allows functions of a
single argument.  The class RealValuedFunctionTwo is similarly a
subclass of RealValuedFunctionVA but represents functions with two
arguments. RealValuedFunctionTwo has two subclasses,
BicubicInterpolator and BicubicTriangleInterp both used to
interpolate values within a small region.  One class represents a
special case: RealValuedFunctionVA.Linear is a real-valued function
that is a linear combination of instances of RealValuedFunction. The
first argument is passed to each RealValuedFunction. The other
arguments provide factors by which the values for each of these
functions of one argument are multiplied. One use of
RealValuedFunction.Linear is for least-square fits.
<P>
The classes RealValuedFunction, RealValuedFunctionTwo, and
RealValuedFunctionThree implement the interfaces
RealValuedFunctOps, RealValuedFunctTwoOps, and RealValuedFunctThreeOps
respectively. These interfaces provide a single method that
computes a function's value given its arguments. These allow the
corresponding functions to be specified using lambda expressions.
In cases where a function's derivatives are not used or where one
will not try to determine if a function's arguments are in its
domain, the BZDev class library will use these interfaces instead
of the classes that implement them so that lambda expressions can
be used if desired.
<P>
The classes CubicSpline, CubicSpline1, and CubicSpline2 provide
a facility for creating cubic splines. A cubic spline is a subclass
of RealValuedFunction so that a function and a spline representation
can be used interchangeably. When an inverse exists, the CubicSpline
class can compute it (the algorithm uses a binary search to find
the interval over which a specific cubic polynomial applies and then
computes the inverse using the closed-form solution for the polynomial's
roots). CubicSpline itself is an abstract class: users will create
instances of CublicSpline1 or CubicSpline2.  CubicSpline1 uses an
evenly spaced set of values in the function's domain, whereas CubicSpline2
uses a variably spaced set of values.
<P>
The class BSpline allows one to create B-splines (Basis splines).
While B-splines are used in computer graphics applications, they can
also be used for curve fitting and other applications. The BSpline class
supports both periodic an non-periodic splines.  The implementation
includes constructing a BSpline by using a least-squares fits to data points.
Similarly, the class BSplineArray produces arrays for a given argument,
where each component can be represented as a BSpline  The class NurbsArray
creates a NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline). This is essentially a
B-spline in homogeneous coordinates where the component for the extra
dimension is also a function of the curve's parameter.
<P>
A series of classes are provided for computing least square fits.
LeastSquaresFit itself is an abstract class, with subclasses handling
various cases: fits to polynomials, fits to a linear combination of
functions (i.e., basis functions), and fits in which the functions are
not linear functions of their parameters.  The non linear fits use the
class LMA, which implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for
minimizing a sum of squares.
<P>
The class {@link StaticRandom} provides an
application-wide random number generator. The quality of the random
numbers produced can be changed at run time. The class
{@link PoissonTable} provides an efficient mechanism for generating
Poisson-distributed values for relatively small values of the parameter
&lambda;.
<P>
Finally, the TridiagonalSolver class solves a linear system of
equations that can be represented by matrices with non-zero
elements on only the diagonal and adjacent to the diagonal.  The
LUDecomp class implements LU Decomposition, used to invert matrices
and solve systems of linear equations, the Permutation class
represents permutation matrices in an efficient form, the Adder
class and its inner classes implement Kahan's summation algorithm
and the pairwise algorithm for summing a series of numbers so as to
mitigate floating-point errors, and the VectorOps class implements
some vector-algebra operations.
